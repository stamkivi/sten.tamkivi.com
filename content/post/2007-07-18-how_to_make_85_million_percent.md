I will eat my hat if this is not one of the highest margin products in the world. 150ml of Evian water for about 7 EUR (47 EUR per liter!) because&#8230; you can spray it! (I&#8217;m sure many people have tried this spraying trick with the plain old water and miserably failed, right?)
  
The product on the shelf above (not displayed) gets even better &#8211; a 50ml bottle of the same thing runs at a calculated liter price of 76 EUR! For comparision, a cubic meter or _1000_ liters of tap water in Tallinn, Estonia where this picture was taken at [costs about 0.9 EUR][2]. That&#8217;s 0.0009 EUR per liter.
  
This is potentially a 8 500 000% profit for you if your brand is strong enough to turn people insane and make them buy your water in a bottle. With a spray. I&#8217;m sure the packaging and transport will cut a few thousand percent off the margin, but you&#8217;re still OK.
  
For additional data read what [AskPablo recently calculated on the true costs of exotic water imports from Fiji to the US][3].
  
And if you should ever buy something like sprayable Evian, unsubscribe from this blog and just go and stand ashamed in the corner.
