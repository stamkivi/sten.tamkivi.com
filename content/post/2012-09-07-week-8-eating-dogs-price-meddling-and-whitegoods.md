### Stanford GSB Sloan Study Notes, Week 8, Summer quarter

Pages assigned for reading: ~135

This was also a week of Strategy Beyond Markets exam (24 hours to answer ~10 questions in &#8220;hopefully less than&#8221; 3 hours and 16 pages; took me 5h and 10 pages -we&#8217;ll see&#8230;), a very inspiring guest speaker session with [Phil Libin][1] of [Evernote][2] (with a surprising amount of cultural parallels to early-days Skype) and series of visiting friends on campus, with Ott actually surviving an entire Microeconomics class (photo courtesy of another guest, [Silver][3]):

Usual format of study notes follow, with maybe more than usual further reading / viewing links in the end.

**GSBGEN259 &#8211; Ethics (prof Krehbiel)**

  * Four less-than-adequate, yet popular basic theories for right conduct: 
      * Ethical egoism: an act is right when it best promotes the individual&#8217;s long-term self-interest 
          * Challenge: a murderer and resisting victim are both morally right and neither could be judged
      * Ethical relativism: right and wrong are a function of the moral teachings of a particular society 
          * Challenge: based deeply on tolerance (an universal moral value), yet it followed through, would require one to also tolerate a deeply intolerant society militantly enforcing its values on another society. E.g no external judging of genocide if it is considered right by one side?
      * Religious/Revealed Ethics: ethical guidance and instruction derived of a particular religious tradition and sacred texts 
          * Challenges: diversity of religious disciplines. Virtually no sacred scripture or teaching is self-explanatory and needs interpretation (independent rational basis of judgement). A statement that a God is &#8220;just and loving&#8221; is based on… the ordinary human meanings of these terms (infinite loop if right is defined as the &#8220;will of God&#8221;?)
          * Most religious/revealed ethics are a superset of, and thus largely compatible with secular/rational ethics (e.g most condemn violence, theft, dishonesty, etc)
      * Right as conscience alone: right defined by &#8220;internal dictate&#8221; alone, with nothing more said 
          * Challenge: personal moral judgement should a reflective and reasoned act, seeking to understand and decide weather a course of action is right or wrong. Isolation and lack of dialogue make &#8220;conscience&#8221; an impenetrable back box anyone can use to justify any conduct.
          * <!--more-->

  * Ayn Rand: &#8220;people _should_behave this way…&#8221;, Milton Friedman: &#8220;people do behave…&#8221; 
      * Both assume: markets are free & laws are just (good luck on both)
  * Corporate Social Responsibility (beyond the common forms of it being just window dressing) is sacrificing some self interest (profits) for societal good 
      * ex: adding safety features on a gas burner. CSR are _only those beyond the profit maximisation point_
      * often an attempt to internalize or mitigate against non-market threats
  * Enlightenment-era moral philosophers 
      * &#8220;[they would] close the matter on moral ambiguities, as any clear-headed thinker would arrive at the same judgments regardless of status or circumstance. Those who did not could be dismissed as cloudy-headed thinkers who would eventually arrive at the “correct” conclusion once they set aside self-interest and overcame stupidity.&#8221;
  * “na ̈ıve realists” (Robinson et al., 1995): assuming that their perception of the world is a veridical representation of its actual properties rather than a subjective perception of the world as it merely appears to them. 
      * Others who perceive the world differently are therefore logically seen as motivationally distorted by self-interest, mentally crippled by stupidity, or both (Pronin et al., 2002).
      * Because egocentric evaluations happen rapidly, unintentionally, effortlessly, and without conscious awareness (i.e., automatically; Bargh, 1994), there is no trace of biased reasoning or ethical subjectivity to stimulate judgmental correction (Wilson and Brekke, 1994).
  * Egocentric biases: people tend to overestimate the extent… 
      * to which others notice and attend to their behavior (Gilovich and Savitsky, 1999)
      * to which their internal states are transparent to others (Gilovich et al., 2000; Vorauer and Ross, 1999)
      * to which others will share their attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, and emotional reactions (Keysar and Barr, 2002; Prentice and Miller, 1993; Ross et al., 1977)
  * Trick to test more &#8220;automatic&#8221; biases in subjects: ask them to evaluate things while keeping a 6-digit number in mind (cognitive overload)\
  * There is (at best) a weak relationship between moral reasoning and moral action (Haidt, 2001) 
      * can be almost completely explained by covariation with intelligence instead (low IQ -> less impulse control, more negative morality)
  * Intuitional (as opposed to rational) model of moral judgement: 
      * moral judgments are based upon rapid and automatic emotional responses to morally relevant stimuli (i.e., moral intuitions) 
          * moral intuition: &#8220;sudden appearance in consciousness of a moral judgment, including an affective valence (good–bad, like–dislike), without any conscious awareness of having gone through steps of searching, weighting evidence, or inferring a conclusion” (Haidt, 2001)
          * example: &#8220;Your dog, a favourite pet for 10 years was hit by a car, right in front of the house. Your family gathers around the good old friend only to see it die in your arms. You decide, that to honor the dog&#8217;s life you will cook and eat it for family dinner.&#8221; &#8212; the (likely) reaction of disgust and disbelief comes automatically, much quicker than you would be rationally able to argument _why_ you feel that way
      * moral reasoning is a post hoc explanation or justifica- tion of these emotional reactions
      * clinical psychopaths who show no decrement in reasoning abilities but generally do not experience emotional reactions to arousing stimuli, especially negative stimuli (Cleckley, 1955; Hare, 1993)
  * Different moral arguments depending on which constituencies&#8217; judgements matter to you: 
      * shareholders: Friedmanesque profit maximisation focus
      * internal (leadership, staff): _potential_ (yellow flag) moral issues with market could be enough to seek other markets
      * external (public, activists searching a scapegoat, …): needs risk calculation per Strategy Beyond Markets
  * Moral judgement can be based on&#8230; 
      * Utilitarianism: maximum wellbeing (costs are left on the table &#8211; who will pick them up?)
      * Paternalism: imposing _your_ values on others
      * Rights: e.g. human rights of an unborn baby in abortion discussion
  * Book recommendations on decision making, judgement, etc:

**MGTECON209 &#8211; Statistics & Economics (prof Oyer)**

  * When price taker competitive firms can only change their production quantity to maximise profit (price is given by the market), monopolies can choose either their quantity or price. 
      * … just not both at the same time (high quantity & high price -> infinite profit), in other words: can&#8217;t pick a point above the demand curve
  * Two-step analysis for maximising profit 
      * Determine output quantity Q* which makes highest possible profit (marginal revenue = marginal cost)
      * Decide if it should benefit more from producing Q* or shutting down
  * True maximum of profits is to grab all consumer surplus and turn it into producer surplus
  * Linear demand curve is more elastic in smaller quantities, therefore 
      * Monopoly profit is maximised in the elastic portion of the demand curve
      * Monopoly never operates in the inelastic portion of its demand curve
  * Question: why is the Marginal Revenue of a monopoly &#8220;half&#8221; of its demand curve? (two times steeper slope) Mathematically provable, but what is the real-life parallel?
  * Marginal cost/revenue is a derivative of cost/revenue 
      * if MC/MR is a straight line, you can deduct C & R are quadratic functions (where the marginals were derived from)
      * ex: p = 24 &#8211; Q; R = pQ = 24Q &#8211; Q^2; MR = 24 &#8211; 2Q
  * On monopoly cost advantage protection 
      * Secrecy is more commonly used for protecting process innovation, patents used more than secrecy to protect product innovation (Levin et al 1987)
  * Pricing discrimination: 
      * As long as the cost of differentiating markets is negligible, a firm cannot do worse by pricing markets separately
      * Lower prices to those with more elastic demands & vice versa
      * With super high elasticity (almost vertical demand curve), not worth the trouble &#8211; just take the high profit one way 🙂
      * When you see a highly complex way of price discrimination, always consider an alternative hypothesis that someone just screwed up
      * eBay example: 
          * 100 people selling 100 items: is is just a market in action
          * 1 person selling same item to 100 people with varied prices: price discrimination
      * Degrees of Price Discrimination: 
          * Third &#8211; product differentiated such that different prices can be charged
          * Second &#8211; non-linear prices (volume discounts, fixed fees)
          * First &#8211; individually tailored prices
  * Externalities are effects (both positive or negative) of production & consumption of good that are not captured by price
  * Network externality definition: People use a product because [other] people use a product.
  * A reaction function: modelling the interdependent price or quantity or two parties on the single graph as two linear functions 
      * For example: one axis is quantity of books & other quantity of coffee. And two lines show quantity of books sold given a certain quantity of coffee next doors & the other one vice versa.
      * Their intersection is the equilibrium point from game theory point of view
      * For strategic applications think of the underlying _price_ (which you can change), yet OK to use quantity in calculations as a proxy (changes as a function of price you set)
  * Triggering anti-trust intervention from governments 
      * collusion (price fixing) between substitute goods (ex: Coke & Pepsi) is bad
      * in case of complementing goods (books & coffee), _collusion actually increases both consumer & producer surplus!_ 
          * in one-directional positive externality, only losers are the small subset of illiterate coffee lovers
  * Tragedy of the Commons inside corporations 
      * If two divisions are using shared resource and their performance is measured as local optimum, the profit will be suboptimal for the corporation as a whole 
          * Solution: bonuses on corporate profit instead (issue: free riding)
          * Solution: activity based costing &#8211; charging a corporate &#8220;tax&#8221; on divisions per each instance of shared resource use (issue: complexity)
  * Taxes create distortions in market (bad) 
      * yet, if the markets are already distorted (failing), taxes can actually help improving the situation

**Effective Communication preview (prof Schramm)**

  * In &#8220;art and science of&#8221; communication, the art bit is often called style
  * Nuances about secondary audiences 
      * they are (potentially) unintentional (&#8220;consider if you&#8217;d like to ready X on the cover of NYT&#8221;)
      * they are sometimes _more important_ than primary ones 
          * cascading down messages through reporting lines
          * interfacing with gatekeepers in sales process
  * A great example of a reversal speech: Barbara Bush&#8217; Commencement Speech at Wellesley College 
      * Here is the video: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxhuPIzOIfc>
      * And found a good summary writeup online, in an Iowa state [Masters thesis by Christopher Anderson][8] (pages 5-21)
  * Free 15-minute video [communication lessons created by Stanford GSB students][9]
  * Big stage talk series (with coaching and mentoring) for students on advanced communications level at Stanford GSB: [LOWKeynotes][10]
