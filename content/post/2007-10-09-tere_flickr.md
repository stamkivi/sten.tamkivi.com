Messing around with travel pictures today on [Flickr][2] I suddenly noticed that their front page greets me in Estonian. No, this is not localization (they still only support 6 languages), just one of the randomized foreign language tutorial/greetings. Cute, nevertheless.
  
Weird how after that I have started noticing other interesting versions such as Lingala, Ma√∂ri and Tshiluba rotating in the same real estate. This happened only now after seeing a familiar, but surprising phrase there once. The same level of attention was never &#8220;bought&#8221; with the usual Hindi, Portugese and German greetings I&#8217;ve known they use there.
  
So&#8230; what? Flickr has conceptually changed the way people organize and share their photos online. That sort of fundamental interface approach change is virtually impossible without grabbing users&#8217; full attention first.
  
Maybe there are more cognitive (not just functional) tricks around the successful web2.0 sites like Flickr that users even don&#8217;t realize exist, but what keep them attached?
