As it isn&#8217;t a good tone to have a blog sit stale for a year, I figured this place deserves at least a brief set of links as an update on what&#8217;s been happening.

The [EIR period at Andreessen Horowitz][1] was not only amazing on personal level, but also fruitful professionally. Even though I wrapped up there only in May, since beginning of this year I&#8217;ve been working on my next startup venture: [Teleport][2]. We officially founded it with <a href="http://twitter.com/keskkyla" target="_blank">Silver</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/balajis" target="_blank">Balaji</a> in April, [closed some seed funding][3] soon after and now have been head down building team and product.

On November 14th, we released the first modest piece of our location search tech in public preview, aimed at helping startup people **<a href="https://bayarea.teleport.org" target="_blank">find the best place to live in the San Francisco Bay Area &#8211; give it a try</a>** and tell me what you think!

If you&#8217;re interested more about what we&#8217;re up to, read the <a href="http://teleport.org/2014/05/welcome/" target="_blank">coming-out-of-the-closet blog post from April</a>, or a more recent one <a href="http://teleport.org/2014/11/place-scout-startup-people/" target="_blank">explaining our focus on startup people</a>. Or just lean back and let me explain it to you in 10 minutes in a speech held at Slush 2014:

It is quite amusing now to see how all of this builds on my <a title="Looking at Europe from Silicon Valley at Slush 2013" href="http://sten.tamkivi.com/2013/12/looking-at-europe-from-silicon-valley-at-slush-2013/" target="_blank">Slush 2013 speech and blogpost series on Looking at Europe from Silicon Valley</a>&#8230; Some things are just meant to come together, I guess.

As you can guess, life on the early stage startup road is quite busy, the good kind of busy. Hence you can find me quicker at these places than on this personal blog for now:
