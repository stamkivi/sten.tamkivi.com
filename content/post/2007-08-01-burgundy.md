Spent five days of my vacation in France to get Burgundy checkmark to the wine-areas-visited list, next to Bordeaux and French Catalonia (Languedoc Roussillon) trips from a few years ago. [Chateau du Four de Vaux][2] was our base camp pictured above. Should you ever look for a place to chill at with a group of friends &#8211; very highly recommended.
  
As [Kusti][3] has already done some more thorough reporting (in Estonian) on our visits to [Joseph Drouhin winery in Beaune][4] and [Francois Freres oak cask factory in St-Romaine][5], I will spare you of the quick&#8217;n&#8217;dirty summaries for now. However especially the cask making process was very interesting, so I might return to it. Until then &#8211; mobile photoset [available here][6].
