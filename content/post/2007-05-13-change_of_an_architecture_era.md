This sample is quite mild compared to some [really extreme examples][2] of early-90s opulent residential architecture risen from that newly found independence and wealth. Still, a brave man to take it down now to &#8211; hopefully &#8211; build something really nice instead, considering this unique location right by the sea.
  
A few hundred meters from the residence of late [President Lennart Meri][3], at Kabelineeme, Viimsi, Estonia.

UPDATE: [Eesti Ekspress has picked up the story][4] and apparently no such luck as hoped above. Same architect, the new house will be 1000 sq meters instead of current 600.
