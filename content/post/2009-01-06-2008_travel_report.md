Looking back at 2008 I discovered that it was a quiet one &#8212; travel-wise that is. Mostly I have to thank [Etta for her appearance in May][1] and becoming a good excuse for some no-fly-zone right before and paternity leave after, running into the summer.

  * Number of business trips: ~15
  * Flight legs: ~32 (+ 3 international trains)
  * Days away from home: ~67 
      * London: 41 days (including one almost-a-month with whole family again)
      * Luxembourg: 11 days
      * San Jose / San Francisco: 7 days
      * Prague: 3 days
      * Brussels: 2 days
      * Paris, Athens, Helsinki: 1 day each (the latter only due to a canceled flight)

All-in-all, I was away 30% less and took almost 50% less flights than the year before. More [video calls][2], logistical efficiency and less carbon footprint&#8230;

It was really nice to spend most of vacation time in Estonia, adding just over a week in Italy (first time there, btw) with two more flights. I am a bit sad not to make it over to Asia this year, those trips have always been a delight, especially Tokyo.
