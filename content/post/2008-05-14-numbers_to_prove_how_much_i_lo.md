Played around with some simple queries in my active [Skype][1] chats database, which weighs 215MB in plain text and has data since May 16th 2006. Probably I did a computer migration around then and earlier history (since I started using an early beta of Skype in mid-2003) is buried somewhere in backups.

Found out that I have sent 59709 and received 273715 messages during this time. And respectively 27389 outbound and 140505 inbound messages in the year of 2007. That&#8217;s an average of 75 / 385 messages per calendar day. I don&#8217;t even want to think if these numbers were my e-mail traffic&#8230;

I also found out that a week of vacation has a 5x lowering impact on my Skype communications &#8211; 132 messages out /1980 in last 7 days, versus a random weekly sample from a month ago 587 out / 2658 in.

And I also found out that my SQL skills have gone really, really rusty even compared to the mediocre level they used to be at.
