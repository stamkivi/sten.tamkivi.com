In October, I had what I figured to be one the weirdest cab rides ever. Our driver in Tokyo revealed surprising knowledge of Estonia and the Baltics, which he gained through his interest in&#8230; maps. If you assumed that the brave men of this trade limit themselves to just studying local street names, think again. ([5 minute video clip of that ride available on Blip.tv][1])

Now, half a year later in London the following dialogue took place in an ordinary black cab, heading home with friends around midnight.

**Driver:** &#8220;Excuse me, listening to you speak I can&#8217;t help but wonder &#8211; are you from Norway?&#8221;

**Us:** &#8220;Close, but it&#8217;s actually Estonian&#8221;

**Driver:** &#8220;I though it sounded Scandinavian! I&#8217;ve never met Estonians before! Actually, you&#8217;re right, I was quite off &#8211; your speech sounds more like Finnish. _Suomi_, or how you say it. But again, this is the same Fenno-Ugric language group as Estonian, silly me&#8230;

You know, I know some Turkish and there are some resemblances there as well. If I&#8217;m not mistaken, Estonians started moving from the Altai mountains towards Europe, along with Finns and Hungarians about 10,000 years ago, wasn&#8217;t it? Hungarians came in waves, right, there was some tribe first and then the Magyars&#8230; Did you know that Turks have this interesting legend that their Heartland once expanded as far as Finland?&#8221;

**Us:** &#8220;umm&#8230; uuuh?&#8221;

**Driver:** &#8220;Coming from Scandinavia, I&#8217;m sure you like [Knut Hamsun][2]? I just love him, you know. His writing has this sense of clarity&#8230;&#8221;

**Us:** &#8220;He could have been in our mandatory reading in highschool, but can&#8217;t really remember&#8230;&#8221;

**Driver:** &#8220;Really? That&#8217;s surprising, I would have imagined that in Estonia you read more of [Bulgakov][3] and [Dostoevsky][4]. I do love reading these chaps as well! In Master and Margarita, I&#8217;ve always admired how Bulgakov teases the Russian Orthodox church, that was not a common practice at all at his time&#8230;

But speaking of these lads, you have to agree that they could not have been if it wasn&#8217;t for [Mikhail Lermontov][5]. That Raskolnikov character in Crime And Punishment would never have existed if there wasn&#8217;t the legacy of A Hero of Our Time&#8230; 

Other than these, I don&#8217;t really appreciate Russian literature of the 19th century&#8230; Too streamlined, if you asked me, to be honest. A Hero of Our Time truly was ahead of its time, written in 1890, was it, but the rest of it&#8230;

Anyway, don&#8217;t want to keep you for long, lads, here we are. Very nice chatting with you, let&#8217;s carry on next time, &#8216;aight? Cheers!&#8221;

And off he drove.

Leaving me and my friend no other option than sit down in the closest pub to transcript this encounter with a suspected literature and linguistics professor in disguise. He did miss with that Lermontov date by a few decades, but still&#8230;
