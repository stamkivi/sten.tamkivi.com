Fighting the awful sunburn from Saturday I went to a store with an intent to fetch different liquids in wholesale quantities. That&#8217;s what water and &#8212; God forbid! &#8212; beer shelves looked like&#8230;
  
Thought 1: how much planning effort would it really take to increase supply of the very basic goods specific for a season?
  
Though 2: goods that were out were very brand specific. Does the fact that [A. LeCoq][3] was out, but plenty of [Saku][4] left tell us what consumers love? Or just who&#8217;s logistics work?
