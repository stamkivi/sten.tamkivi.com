PC World has published [a comparative review on video sharing sites][1]. With the exception of Korea and France, [YouTube][2] still seems to be the #1 global option to get distribution for your flicks. However &#8212; as I&#8217;ve also concluded recently for myself &#8212; there is so much variety of (non-clone!) alternatives out there that beat the YT-behemoth hands down on quality, interesting niche approaches, revenue sharing models and more.

I&#8217;m especially happy that [Blip.tv][3] ([a recent ASI investment][4]) has come out first on [PC World&#8217;s Top10 quality chart][5] (check out the [side-by-side embedded video comparision page][6] as well).

The premiering content partners for [Skype&#8217;s video sharing][7], [Dailymotion][8] and [Metacafe][9] also get mentioned. First as the feeder of all those French eyeballs and second for the monetization models for independent producers. [Get Skype for Windows 3.5 gold][10] or later to share the content of those two sites with your contacts.
