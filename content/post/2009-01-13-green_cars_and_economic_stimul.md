Heard on the morning news that the German $66B economic stimulus package passed today also includes a measure to encourage people replace their cars. It is _sort of_ understandable as a short term measure, as their economy is quite reliant on the infamous German car makers [who, of course, are looking at a bleak 2009][1]. Still if you think of, say, a few million germans rushing to buy new cars and dump their (probably well-running) existing ones &#8212; doesn&#8217;t sound that reasonable from long term environmental damage point of view.

I [looked it up][2], and it comes out that&#8230;

> Other measures include a 2,500 euro payment for drivers who buy a new low- emission car.

Now, depending on what &#8220;low emission&#8221; means in this case the measure could work either way &#8211; for German manufacturers or for the environment. For some reason I doubt that these two goals could be obviously achieved together, or at least perceptionally &#8220;green&#8221; and &#8220;german&#8221; are not the first semantic associations that pop into mind as a bundle when thinking about cars&#8230;

Toyota [announced their new Prius][3] yesterday. Looking slightly better (but not beautiful), adding a few interesting innovations (such as solar-paneled moonroof that generates power for the ventilation on hot days) and less than 5l/100km (50mpg) fuel consumption it is a worthy upgrade to what has already been a great if somewhat quirky car till now.

Toyota basically owns the hybrid car market, [claiming 91% market share in Europe in 2006][4]. So putting one and one together &#8211; to what extent will the German government be supporting the Japanese economy instead of their own with their new car purchase support measure?
