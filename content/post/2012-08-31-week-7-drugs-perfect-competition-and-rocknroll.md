With the Negotiations crash course ending, due date and presentations of the group projects in Strategy Beyond Markets and all kinds of housekeeping for study groups and Winter/Spring quarter high demand class application &#8220;superrounds&#8221; and now a long Labour Day weekend ahead, this week turned out to be quite a gear shift down&#8230; But a few notes to take down still.

**POLECON239 &#8211; Strategy Beyond Markets (prof Jha)**

  *  &#8220;You can always trust the USA to do the right thing, once they have exhausted all other alternatives&#8221; &#8211; Churchill
  * The public pressure on AIDS drugs pricing in Sub-Saharan Africa made US government to _stop pressuring_developing countries on pharma IP issues in 90s 
      * Did not officially change their view on TRIPS and other international agreements &#8211; those still in force
      * Yet &#8220;closed&#8221; an eye so that Brazil, Thailand, South Africa, India could start producing cheap copies
      * US own GlaxoSmithkline put into substantially worse competitive situation
  * Class-triggered open question to self: what happens to the pharma IP dynamic in the context of medical singularity (e.g when less than a year of treatment can add more than a year to a human&#8217;s lifespan)? 
      * typical conflict cases (pricing, access to drugs in developing world) to date seem to focus on medication that is intended to reduce suffering, fix diseases, delay death through sickness
      * how will the global relations and corporate VS public needs play out when the drugs are not about _fixing_ _diseases_, but enhancing/prolonging _healthy life_?<!--more-->

  * Allegedly some data shows PE/VC investments into life sciences with a negative return over last 20 years?! 
      * Herbert &#8211; can you find a link to go deeper on this? whose data?
  * Decomposition of complex issues is a natural problem solving heuristic for humans 
      * Integration of those pieces later is not
      * Very important for managing the complexity of non-market interactions
  * Any non-market interaction can… 
      * mitigate effects (example: what happens when Iran stops selling oil?)
      * magnify effects (example: actors respond to each others&#8217; behaviour by becoming _more_ involved. accentuates the challenge)
  * Market & non-market competition: 
      * Similarities: you can think of political action in supply and demand terms (politicians vs electorate)
      * Differences: 
          * Voluntary exchange (market) versus coercive (institutions) power
          * Coin of the realm: $$ (market) versus sources of access, rights, influence (non access)

**MGTECON209 &#8211; Statistics & Economics (prof Oyer)**

  * In simplest competition models supply slopes up because higher prices induce increase in current suppliers production or entry of new identical firms
  * In perfectly competitive markets 
      * fixed costs tend to be _more avoidable_(sounds like a paradox) 
          * reason: if the market entry is really easy, it is more likely you can sell your entire business as a single item (ex: dry cleaners or news stand)
      * price can be deducted from knowing only the cost (no information of demand needed)
  * Long-term economic (not accounting) profit of competitive markets is zero 
      * economic costs include all opportunity costs (value of leisure, ROI of benchmark competition &#8211; like 20% return of capital, any other alternative uses of the same capital)
      * meanwhile, accounting profit is higher than zero because all these costs are hard to adequately account for
      * zero economic profit means the firm is _indifferent_ to being in this business or exiting
  * After shocks, markets return to equilibrium through: entry/exit of firms & increase in incumbent production levels
  * Economics meets philosophy &#8211; analysing equilibria and market outcomes, consider two dimensions 
      * Efficiency &#8211; how large are total benefits for society? 
          * measured through surplus (ideally) or GDP/profits (practically)
          * optimised for by libertarians (extreme), republicans, conservatives
      * Equity &#8211; how fairly are these benefits divided? 
          * measured by metrics such as &#8220;what fraction of wealth held by top X%&#8221;, &#8220;difference in wealth by top and bottom quartiles&#8221;
          * optimised for by communists (extreme), democrats
  * Supply curve is a flat horizontal line for long-term, perfect markets with free entry 
      * In that situation, producer surplus is zero
  * We wish markets as a whole operated as a firm (marginal revenue = marginal cost), but that of course never happens
  * Global trade increases _global_welfare 
      * Locally measured welfare might not: e.g blue-collar jobs shifting from US to China much faster than high value add ones -> unemployment numbers differ in segments -> income gap grows
  * Main reasons for market inefficiencies 
      * Market power (infrastructure-based monopolies)
      * Externalities not captured by the price system 
          * for example: larger share of poor has indirect societal cost through crime
      * Information limits 
          * Great experiment of mobile coverage expanding on coast of India. The fisherman had to choose which village they try to sell their daily catch based on very low information (guessing/hoping where demand would be). With mobiles, the actual sales price corridor narrowed from 2..16 to 7..9 rupees per unit & the amount of fish unsold and thrown away by the evening dropped to zero.
  * Ecomics is about _maximising_** **the pie, market strategy about _capturing_ a slice of the pie
  * We tolerate market inefficiencies because market power (like granted IP protection for a time period) makes innovation worthwhile
  * Most interventions in competitive markets (taxes, subsidies) lower total surplus (consumer + producer) 
      * hurt consumers and/or cost governments more than they help producers
      * yet, they provide infrastructure to make markets more efficient or break monopolies / limit market power

**Managing Difficult Conversations** session (actually a waste of half a day, but trying to extract something positive nevertheless..)

  * [Thomas Killman Conflict Mode Instrument][1] 
      * One thought combining TKI & the Negotiations learnings: if you imagine a conflict of interest in a situation involving people of different power, like a customer & a super market clerk 
          * there is a possible reaction of strong competition/conflict triggered because of the clear difference in power (TKI scale: High Assertiveness, focus on your interests) makes &#8220;winning&#8221; likely (spend an hour to escalate to clerk&#8217;s manager, argue, fight…)
          * …whereas there is virtually zero value in the future relationship (TKI: Cooperativeness, focus on relationships) and thus the rational choice could be avoid/ignore conflict (do something else with the hour that actually benefits you)
  * Suggested quick end-of-project peer to peer feedback format between all team members: &#8220;Because of you, I <insert learning>&#8221;
