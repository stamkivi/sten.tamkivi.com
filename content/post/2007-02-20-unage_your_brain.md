A [friend][1] recently pinged me in fear:
  
_[13.02.2007 21:48:36] DS: anyway, wii is blaming me that my &#8220;fitness age is 66 years&#8221; and nintendo ds claims that my &#8220;brain age is 55 years&#8221;&#8230;_

For added context, he is not that much over 30.

I remembered this chat when I read about the [4-week Quest to Be Smarter][2] in Wired. There still is hope, isn&#8217;t there?

Even though I never played either of the devices referred to, I think out of the list of things to do to improve I&#8217;m doing fine only on the coffee front. My average hours of sleep per night probably are around 5-6 hours lately. And the diet of choice: tasty. Even though the latter would probably improve both the Wii and Nintendo DS performance.
