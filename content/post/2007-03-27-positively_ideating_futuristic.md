Inspired bt wolli&#8217;s [recent revelation][1] I&#8217;m publishing my personal strengths as well.
  
[Read more][2] about the thinking on why should I care, but in a nutshell:

> People progress more rapidly in their areas of greatest talent than in their areas of weakness. Yet too many training and development approaches focus on making improvements in areas of weakness.

In other words: Trying only to fix what you suck at is purely risk mitigation for that you mess something up you shouldn&#8217;t be doing to start with.

So here we go:

<!--more-->

> **Ideation**
  
> People strong in the Ideation theme are fascinated by ideas. They are able to find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena.
  
> **Woo**
  
> People strong in the Woo theme love the challenge of meeting new people and winning them over. They derive satisfaction from breaking the ice and making a connection with another person.
  
> **Communication**
  
> People strong in the Communication theme generally find it easy to put their thoughts into words. They are good conversationalists and presenters.
  
> **Futuristic**
  
> People strong in the Futuristic theme are inspired by the future and what could be. They inspire others with their visions of the future.
  
> **Positivity**
  
> People strong in the Positivity theme have an enthusiasm that is contagious. They are upbeat and can get others excited about what they are going to do. 

It is always very hard to judge how true the reflection of yourself really is, but I think for the most part this is me. Definitely not a pedantic bureaucrat or shy historian. (NB! I love those types by the way and need a plenty around me to delegate the things they are better at than me). Do you agree?
  
The most important takeaway from the exercise: team success is based on combining people with varied (or even opposite) strengths in the right way. And you&#8217;d be surprised from the rainbow of different strengths even a tight like-minded group can carry person by person.
  
PS: I also learned a new word I now like: wooo!
