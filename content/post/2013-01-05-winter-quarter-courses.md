As the Sloan year has passed the equator, I&#8217;ve signed up for the following classes kicking off next week. It is going to be quite intense, 22 units in total and Mondays going from 8am to 9pm&#8230;

**Core classes:**

  * [FINANCE 229][1] &#8211; Sloan: Finance ([Ilya Strebulaev][2])
  * [MKTG 249][3] &#8211; Sloan: Re-Imaging Marketing: The Power of Stories ([Jennifer Aaker][4]; see also her [Story Bank site][5])

Yes, just two this time, leaving more precious time for electives.

**Electives:<!--more-->**

  * [FINANCE 373][6] &#8211; Entrepreneurial Finance (Arthur Korteweg)
  * [FINANCE 385][7] &#8211; Angel & VC Financing seminar ([Ilya Strebulaev][2] and [Theresia Gouw][8])
  * [FINANCE 587][9] &#8211; Private Equity ([George Parker][10])
  * [MS&E 274][11] &#8211; Dynamic Entrepreneurial Strategy ([Edison Tse][12])
  * [STRAMGT 354][13] &#8211; Entrepreneurship & Venture Capital ([Peter Wendell][14], [Eric Schmidt][15])

The least I am stepping out of my comfort zone here, but maybe just going insane with four finance classes in one quarter. Half-jokingly, I&#8217;ve got something on foundations, something on handing out money (as an investor) and something on burning it (as an entrepreneur).

Getting into Wendell&#8217;s legendary 354 is a lottery win that I am most looking forward to as something no other business school in the world could ever replicate, looking at the roster of Valley luminary guests starting with Schmidt who will co-run sessions in this course as guests.

And I really wanted to add something more from the Stanford Engineering school to mix the network up a bit, hoping the MS&E take on strategy from an entrepreneurial angle will do the trick.

**Other:**

I will plan to attend as many of the sessions in [Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders][16], [European Entrepreneurship And Innovation][17] and [Human-Computer Interaction Seminar][18]. All their announced speaker schedules look amazing, again, but I will not take them for credit (= mandatory attendance) any more to leave more flexibility in weekly time planning.

Classes I also considered by ended up passing on for various prioritization and scheduling reasons:

  * [GSBGEN 382][19] &#8211; Thinking Like a Lawyer, a course where law school professors explain their art specifically to non-lawyers.
  * [MS&E 283][20] &#8211; Scaling Excellence in Organizations and&#8230;
  * [MS&E 266][21] &#8211; Management of New Product Development. Sounded even more appealing options for inflitrating the Engineering school Masters program than the strategy class I got, but there were unsolvable time conflicts for these&#8230;
  * [OB 671][22] &#8211; Social Psychology in Organizations, an advanced PhD seminar.
  * [MGTECON 334][23] &#8211; The International Economy. I&#8217;ve missed something bringing a bit of non-US angle to my schedule, but eventually not sure if international trade policy, even if intellectually interesting is the biggest gap to fill at the moment.
  * [PSYCH 212][24] &#8211; Social Psychology. A full course on classic studies on experimental psychology, digging deeper on many things we just barely touched in our core Organizational Behaviour courses. Again, time conflicts&#8230;

&#8212;

See also:

  * My class selections from [Summer][25] and [Autumn][26] quarters.
  * I&#8217;m now maintaining a [list of all books assigned as reading in my Stanford courses here][27].
  * And there is now an exhaustive [table of contents page for all of my Sloan year writing][28] on this blog.
