[Just like in 2006][1] I took a look back to the calendar again to recap the time spent on the road (or in the air for that matter) in 2007:
  
* Number of business trips: ~28
  
* Flight legs: 79
  
* Days away from home: ~95
  
* London: 67 days (including a ~30 day stretch stay, though)
  
* Prague: 8 days
  
* Luxembourg: 6 days
  
* San Jose: 6 days
  
* Tokyo: 4 days
  
* Brussels: 2 days
  
* Netherlands: 2 days
  
Now, when it almost seems that the year on year travel stayed basically flat, I also looked at family holiday trips. These four (Tenerife, Burgundy, ZÃ¼rich & Dominican Republic) add to another 14 flights to get away for ~30 days. Of course, with your loved ones along, those were much preferable kind of &#8220;away from home&#8221;.
  
Since you asked &#8211; yes, I am laid back in an armchair at home right this very second. And loving it.
