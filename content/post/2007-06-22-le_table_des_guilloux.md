Had an excellent dinner with colleagues at [Le Table des Guilloux][2] a bit outside Luxembourg city. As it was quite late on Sunday evening and after two tiring delayed flights, I did not feel like taking written or even mental notes on what exactly we had for food and wine, just enjoyed ourselves. To put it bluntly in the non-gourmet-review language:
  
* Oysters were the sweetest I&#8217;ve ever had. Almost as if they were caramel filled.
  
* Asparagus under perfectly lightly crusty white fish (I&#8217;m sure it had a beautiful French name) had gone a bit mushy
  
* Warm cherry dessert of the day stopped any conversation around the table for 15 minutes at least
  
* The _sommelier_ surprised with both the main and dessert course selections, especially the latter of replacing the too-easy-to-default-to Sauternes with something much lighter and richer in nuances. (I actually wish I did take a picture of that bottle.)
  
All-in-all I am not quite sure if the place is worth both of the [Michelin stars it has][3]. Maybe just Michelin has drifted a bit off course and you always think that multiple stars places need to be somehow cold, formal and clinically exact in what they do. Chef Guilloux&#8217; place feels somehow too homely, with a friendly and even a bit casual service with laughing waiters, owner&#8217;s huge dog laying around and so forth, to be &#8220;starred&#8221;.
  
**VERDICT:** definitively worth getting out of the Lux city limits for a very good dinner.
