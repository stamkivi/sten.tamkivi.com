As [JÃ¼ri announced last week][2], [ArcticStartup.com][3]&#8216;s [ArcticEvening][4] event is coming to Tallinn next Wednesday, Jan 28th, at Von Krahl. In cooperation with [OpenCoffee Tallinn][5] and [Connect Estonia][6].

As the initially planned 100 seats filled up really quickly, the organizers increased it to 150. And at the time I&#8217;m writing this, there are some 28 still left. [So sign up now][1], if you missed from the first batch.

I will be there sitting in a panel with [Allan][7] and [Taneli Tikka][8] from [RunToShop][9]. Looking forward to the pitches from two Estonian and two Finnish startups.
