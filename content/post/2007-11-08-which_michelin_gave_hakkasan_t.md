[Hakkasan][2] ([SkypeFind reviews][3]) has been on my to-go list for a long time. Can&#8217;t even remember who was the very first to recommend it (and maybe the place was just better a year+ ago?). It is right around the corner from our London office, but for a reason or another I never made it.
  
Now I did and what a complete disappointment it was.
  
**GOOD:**
  
* [Those who had &#8217;em][4], praised the cocktails.
  
* Dimsum & duck appetizers were nice.
  
* That&#8217;s it.
  
**BAD:
  
** 
  
* Well manned (headcount-wise), but careless service. The wet wiping cloth coming between you and your food kind.
  
* Robotic sommelier who says his lines and just does not listen if you ask something about the wine. As in ignoring you.
  
* Loud and overcrowded as a cocktail bar&#8230; on the restaurant side on Monday night.
  
* Most appetizers could not compete on Cheap Chinese Takeaway championships if they tried.
  
* My crab (pictured above) tasted like paper towels. I rarely leave my seafood uneaten.
  
* All this and more for about 100 pounds per head.
  
Who exactly decides on Michelin stars these days? Some Anatoli Michelinovski running a parallel business in some dark alley?
  
And #19 in the [50 World&#8217;s Best Restaurants list][5]??? Come on&#8230;
  
PS: my friends say that the same owner&#8217;s [Yauatcha][6] is still a good place for dimsum.
