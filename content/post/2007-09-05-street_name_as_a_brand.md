[Swallow street][2] is located just off Regent street in Westminster. There are a few great restaurants there, for example [Bentley&#8217;s][3] has definitely the best seafood ([and best dressed lemons][4]) I&#8217;ve had in London. Now &#8211; putting two and two together, you get the perfect brand for a restaurant street, worth designing into a logo.
  
There are two more Swallow streets in London. Wonder if they all have good restaurants and share the brand?
