Just finished a video call with Her Majesty \[Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrix\_of\_the_Netherlands).
  
She was visiting Skype Tallinn office as part of her state visit to Estonia. I was babysitting at home. One of these physical location misses when \[Skype\](http://skype.com) really becomes handy.
  
Also, \[Etta\](http://gustavpaul.tamkivi.com/2008/05/11/eriti-uusi-sunnipaevi/) joined the ranks of the babies worldwide who have had their first video call while less than 10 days old.
