[The Design Museum][1] has two cool exhibitions on: Top 25 design icon&#8217;s over the past 25 years (apparently it&#8217;s the museum&#8217;s birthday) and [Luigi Colani][2]&#8216;s Translating nature.

The unbeatable Aeron, the chair of choice for Skype offices ([video proof][4]) worldwide and with the ripple effect into the home offices for many of us (including yours&#8217; truly) was apparently the Design Thing of 1994. Can&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s 13 years ago already, still does look fresh.

Sample of typical (if I may) Colani design. If nothing else you just gotta love those windscreen wipers. Did you know the guy also did the [modern-day Canon SLR body][6]?
