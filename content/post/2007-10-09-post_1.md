Spent a few days in Tokyo. Finally. This place is now officially number #1 in my World Cities toplist. And frankly &#8211; I was sort of expecting (or hoping?) this to happen.
  
The [Skype Developer event][2] I was attending there was a huge success with great turnout of interesting partners. Everything else in the counted few days before and after was just mind-blowing. I need to have the thoughts and emotions settle a bit to blog anything sensible. Until then, [you have to live with the photoset][3].
  
My special thanks go out to German customs who were so happy to see me back in Europe that they decided to welcome me with some extra taxes + a 350 EUR fine, because tumbling off a 12 hour flight I did not voluntarily land in the red customs corridor while I had a certain new gadget in my bag with purchase value exceeding 175 EUR. Did you know that this extremely low threshold is applicable to &#8220;all other items not listed explicitly like alcohol and tobacco&#8221; in whole EU? I do now. Hier, nehmen Sie meine Kreditkarte.
