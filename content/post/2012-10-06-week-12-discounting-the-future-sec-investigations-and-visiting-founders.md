### Stanford GSB Sloan Study Notes, Week 2, Autumn quarter

Covered in this issue:

  * Rational decision making. Why and by how much discount the future?
  * In search for a _strategic fit_ &#8211; those sweet moments when stars actually align for a while. Resulting competitive advantage that holds due to the complexity of interdependencies. Cases: CapitalOne (data driven mass-personalisation) and Lincoln Electric (super productive manufacturing).
  * Real-Life Ethics: Guest Michael Marks on being bullied by huge OEMs while Flextronics CEO. And should a SEC-inestigated company throw an innocent CFO over board to settle? Role of the board in backing the CEO.
  * Guest selling their story: Smule co-founders Jeff Smith & Ge Wang. Andrew Mason of Groupon.
  * Peer-organized public company valuation training.
  * Analysis of a persuasive argument: 1 man turning 11 jurors around in the 12 Angry Men movie. The case of Silicon Valley&#8217;s most effective networker.
  * Cash flow reporting. And intangible assets, especially software.

And here on to the full notes:<!--more-->

**GSBGEN378 &#8211; Decisions About the Future (Hardisty)**

  * [St Petersburg Paradox][1] 
      * how much would you pay to play a coin flip game where the 50/50 payout increases exponentially: ($2^n) for flip n?
      * people tend to offer a few dollars
      * expected value calculation is infinite: EV() = $1 + $1 + $1…
      * expected utility is finite because of the diminishing marginal utility of every next win
  * Rational decision making axioms 
      * connectedness: A **>** B **>=** C
      * dominance: **A** > B >= C
      * transitivity: if A > B >= C then can not be that A < C
      * independence: it A > B then A+$10 > B+$10
      * temporal consistency
  * there is a common intuitive assumption that future societies are richer 
      * advancement in technology, long-term economic growth, …
      * &#8220;spend now rather than save&#8221; = &#8220;us, the poorer, have more use of this than rich of the future&#8221;?
  * reasons to discount future: 
      * analytic convenience (e.g.: infinite investment problem, ex: would make sense to grow social security reserves forever for wider benefit in the future, but recipients start dying at some point)
      * opportunity cost
      * impatience
      * uncertainty
      * interest & inflation
  * if you would not take $105, but take $110 in one year instead of $100 today: 
      * delta = (100 / AVG(105,110) ) ^ (1 / 1year &#8211; 0) = 0.93
      * 93% discount factor, or &#8220;stuff in a year is worth 93% of it&#8217;s today&#8217;s value&#8221; for me
      * in 2 years: 0.93^(1/2-0)=0.865
      * discount rate: (delta-1) = 0.93-1 =0.7% per year
  * [Pascal&#8217;s Wager][2] &#8211; does God exist?
  * [Ben Franklin&#8217;s decision making method][3]

**STRAMGT279 &#8211; Global Strategic Management (Roberts)**

  * [Briefest current definition of strategy][4] by Van den Steen: 
      * just enough management decisions…
      * made up front…
      * to be combined with local information for implementation
  * Strategic positioning: performing _different_ activities or similar activities _differently_ than rivals ([Porter 1996][5]) 
      * variety-based: deep niche or wide horizontal selection of products
      * needs-based: serving most or all needs for particular group of customers (does NOT mean &#8220;serve every random need that is voiced by any customer&#8221;)
      * access-based: a function of customer location, scale, &#8230;
  * Operational effectiveness: doing similar activities _better_than competitors 
      * competition on OE alone is mutually destructive, winners being those who can _outlast_ others in the cycle of becoming more generic and alike
      * pursuit of OE is seductive because it is concrete and actionable
  * Manager-to-client ratios &#8211; a reflection of need-based strategic positioning 
      * Bessemer Trust: 1 per 14 families (>5M investable assets); virtually no loan traffic, but investment & estate management to accounting for racehorses & aircraft
      * Citibank Private: 1 per 125 clients (>250k minimum assets); primarily lenders
      * same value chain couldn&#8217;t profitably meet the needs of both groups
  * Straddle: an attempt of an incumbent to retain their business AND emulate a disruptive newcomer at the same time 
      * Ex: old airlines trying to retain their business while creating no-frills offerings to match the low-cost players
      * usually results in enormous straddling penalties from lack of efficiency of activities (over- or under designed for their purpose), inconsistency of image/reputation and limits on internal coordination & control
  * Strategic fit between activities can be just a _simple consistency_ (companies who want low prices advertise less), _reinforcing_ or _optimisation of effort_ 
      * As competitive advantage raises from entire _system of activities_, the more intertwined & complex the fit, the harder to untangle and replicate it by competition
      * a certain combination of… 
          * position (brand, monopoly/barriers, first mover, AAPL fanboys)
          * capabilities (design, Sony & miniaturisation in 70s)
          * resources
      * quickly diminishing multiplied probabilities that each activity can be successfully copied: 0.9 \* 0.9 \* 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.66
  * Strategic continuity (esp saying no to things decidedly out of scope) _does not_ imply a static view of the markets & competition
  * Capital One case ([SM-135][6]) 
      * &#8220;80% of strategy is figuring out where the world is going and 20% is about what a company is going to do in response to that&#8221; (Fairbank, CEO)
      * &#8220;Decision-making process should be a competition of ideas, not people.&#8221;
      * &#8220;Most executives spend 1% of time recruiting and 75% of time managing their recruitment mistakes.&#8221;
      * [VIDEO: Fairbank in Stanford]
      * on broadening the data-driven culture to new areas (like auto loans): &#8220;Find sleepy, boring industries that are _information_industries in disguise&#8221; (Fairbank) 
          * slow moving
          * less competition
          * great people are usually not rushing into those
  * Capability [to execute a strategy] = there is a _replicable_ process
  * &#8220;being free of preconceptions &  free of knowledge are different things&#8221;
  * Intel builds fabs as &#8220;copy true&#8221; &#8211; _exact replicas_of past fabs (factories of that same generation) 
      * they know they don&#8217;t know why, but it worked &#8211; why introduce unnecessary additional risk to what is very complex production anyway?
  * Books: 
      * [Liar&#8217;s Poker][7]
      * [Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths And Total Nonsense: Profiting From Evidence-Based Management][8]
  * GM labor contracts with unions are 3&#8242; stack of paper 
      * Toyota&#8217;s supplier contracts: 2 pages
      * Goog indicator of trust
  * Trust-driven incentive systems require promotion from within 
      * _participant_ oversight & control
      * manager&#8217;s open doors, worker councils
  * Piece-rate payments to employees are illegal in Germany
  * Difference between labour security: 
      * job security &#8211; in tough times you can do less/worse, but you are not laid off
      * income security &#8211; union favourite for optimising for &#8220;an average worker&#8221;; in tough times prohibitive cost leads to layoffs
  * Fewer non monetary perks 
      * seems &#8220;less caring&#8221; in some hiring competition today
      * alternatively can be viewed as removing them creates more employee choice and freedom
  * International ignorance: After Citibank & Traveller&#8217;s merger, fewer than 1/3 of Traveller&#8217;s board members had passports!
  * Intel was hailing itself to be a DRAM company, but allocated resources based on margin 
      * resource shifted naturally to high-margin processors instead
      * org responded to incentives despite of the top-down communicated strategy
      * Moore & Grove had to reactively decide, how to deal with it (org diverging from agreed strategy!) 
          * checking question &#8220;what would we do if we had just taken over this company today&#8221; led to shutdown of DRAM business
  * Multiple coherent patterns (ex: flexibility vs breadth; agility vs rigid process) 
      * Mix and match does not work.
      * Beware of alleged &#8220;best practice&#8221; out of context.
      * Multiple models in one firm almost surely means trouble, mis-fit 
          * Could be a good hint which parts of the organisation define as independent BUs, where to draw formal interfaces!

**GSBGEN566 &#8211; Real-Life Ethics (Mark Leslie, Peter Levine)**

  * Tech startup blogging policy case recap 
      * setting a policy &#8212; _or not_ &#8212; impacts employee behaviour&#8230;
      * as it creates a moral compass&#8230;
      * for the CEO dilemma: do you back internal (key employee) or external (key partner) in conflict? 
          * decision to not create a policy implicitly means you are trusting employee judgement
      * not solving the problem in time (misjudging the scale of the issue) just makes both sides dig their heels in more
  * [Michael E. Marks][9] &#8211; guest speaker with real-life cases from his Flextronics CEO period
  * &#8220;It is lonely at the top… but you do get to eat better&#8221;
  * Selection of tactics available for an EMS (contract manufacturer) pressured by their OEM clients 
      * negotiate
      * coordinate with other suppliers
      * avoid negative precedent -> ruins the future market &#8220;appropriate terms&#8221;
      * prepare for worst (mainly mentally, hard to do much practically)
      * call the bluff -> don&#8217;t know the reaction 
          * People bluff in business much less than you think!
      * push the issue further down the chain to _your_ suppliers
  * All big companies are by design bullies at times: towards smaller partners, suppliers, even customers
  * Stock market / investor relations consideration: one time payout or long-term loss of customer (discussed by analysts forever)
  * &#8220;Goodwill bank&#8221;: do favours to partners who have a positive goodwill deposit for their past favours
  * Often when you do the &#8220;right thing&#8221; according to your moral values, negative raminifications are on so many people _not_you 
      * Ex: CEO firing 10,000 people due to the business cut by a pissed customer whose ethically questionable proposal CEO refused
  * On CEO asking advice: 
      * should _always_ be able to go to their board, not external mentors, etc
      * if not &#8211; have you got a wrong board?
      * board only has something to do in crisis 
          * CEO dies
          * needs to hire a new CEO
          * CEO needs help/decision (= NOT business as usual)
      * normal, routine board meetings can feel like a waste of time &#8211; but are needed for continuous context for when the crisis (above) hits!
  * A good sign of fraud is that only a few people seem to know about some proposal.
  * Leadership stock purchase plans (putting in own/lent money, not just options) 
      * Lenovo carried out a stock purchase plan for top management by peer pressure: if you&#8217;re not buying, are you in the CEOs circle of trust any more?
      * VP level participation/impact (and thus motivation to buys stock) is very dependent on CEOs leadership style
  * SEC investigations 
      * unlimited police power
      * arms-length teams reporting to board, not management team
      * tactic to isolate all accused: if 10 managers involved, you have each bring their external counsel
      * 2005-09: 2300 filed SEC litigations. If 1/5 of all investigations litigated: 2000 investigations/year
      * VERY expensive to be in this process, innocent or not
  * &#8220;firing&#8221; and &#8220;resigning&#8221; are synonyms in US corporate culture, for the mark on your CV
  * personal ethics VS fiduciary duty 
      * mirror test: &#8220;if I make this decision for shareholder&#8217;s benefit, will I be able to look in the mirror and answer &#8211; who am I?&#8221;

**ACCT219 &#8211; Financial Accounting (Guttman)**

  * In highly leverage companies: cash management needs to be tight (there is interest cost on net cash)
  * _Orders_are a non-event on financial statements, yet 
      * inventory, liabilities, cash can change due to _production_
      * revenue & COGS on _shipment_
  * Dividends & interest received are under Cash Flow from Operating activities in US
  * In theory in US either direct or indirect CF methods are allowed, yet for reconciliation with Net Income in I/S, everyone ends up doing indirect

**Sloan Investment Club &#8211; Valuation training**

  * Difference in cashflow-based valuation methods 
      * DCF (what are the estimated future cash flows worth today) &#8211; a banker spending a day on valuation is already a lot
      * Buyout (what am I willing to pay today to get to the 20% IRR I want over next 5 years) valuations are built often in months, with full access to the books, etc
  * Buyout people look at EBITDA (and -based multiples), because &#8220;everything else below that \_I\_ want to engineer&#8221;

**MS&E 472 &#8211; **[Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders][10]

  * [Jeff Smith & Ge Wang][11] from [Smule][12]
  * See [full video here][13] &#8211; well worth watching for product demos!

Ge:

  * Pan flute flowchart: 
      * Startups are like pan flutes &#8211; you really shouldn&#8217;t do one… unless there is some curiosity you _cannot_ satisfy any other way
  * By sanctioning a rebellion you take all the fun out of it and it dies 
      * Case in point: giving a drum kit to a child
  * Academic institutions / experiments around computerised music: 
      * Stanford [CCRMA][14]
      * Princeton Laptop Orchestra [PLOrk][15]
      * Stanford [SLOrk][16]
      * Stanford Mobile Phone Orchestra [MoPho][17]
  * What is a musical instrument? 
      * A 500-year old Stradivarius in my hands? No, it is not
      * Music = &#8220;expressive sound&#8221;
      * Instrument -> allows you to be musically expressive (defined via the user)
  * YouTube as definite research source for startups (to see pre-product if people care) 
      * Smule&#8217;s Ocarina app born after final confirmation that the &#8220;clay ocarina tutorial&#8221; video on YT had 4M views
  * **Technology should create calm** &#8211; from ubiquitous computing research
  * AutoRap Stress test:

{{< youtube k1DgNfz1g_s >}}

Jeff:

  * Hanging out at a VC firm in ER role is one of the worst places where to contemplate a startup idea 
      * culture focused too much on analysing why it would fail
  * _gesamtkunstprodukt_ &#8211; &#8220;the total product (of art)&#8221;, usable as a product management principle
  * can you build a catch into the first 30 seconds of first-time UX? 
      * if yes &#8211; you get high [K-factor][18]
      * ex: a virtual lighter app on iPhone. yes, you can _blow_ it off too &#8211; something that you want and demo very quickly to your friends.
  * mobile business models trend from paid apps -> content inside free app 
      * Smule&#8217;s extra layer: subscription model to get all content across _all of the company&#8217;s different apps_
  * Hiring philosophy: don&#8217;t sell, roll down the curtains and show the real culture & life inside the company as best as you can 
      * help people to self-select in

**View From the Top speaker series**

[Andrew Mason][19], CEO of Groupon. (video [will be available here][20] at some point, I guess). I never met Andrew in person before, but I expected him to be a bit more energetic, outgoing and edgy. Might be the post-IPO communication rules kicking in, or might be that he has just become more rounded, balanced and serious as the company (and his role) have grown?

  * Tech industry is not as homogenous as it is served sometimes &#8211; you can divide tech companies to two by asking &#8220;how long could their staff stay at home and do nothing and business would still continue?&#8221;) 
      * Pure tech (GOOG, FB, …) &#8211; 6 months?
      * Operational (AMZN, GRPN, …) &#8211; 5 days? 
          * More demanding, daily &#8220;street fight&#8221;
          * Actually not the best fit to be located in Silicon Valley: what do you do when you need to hire 3000 _non-engineering_ people quickly here?
  * Everything &#8220;local&#8221; is an easy business to get into, hard one to scale
  * On evaluating Groupon clones to acquire: 
      * #1 &#8211; people: are there strong leaders who can continue growing the business semi-autonomously
      * will it work with US folks being physically over only rarely?
      * speed of growth via M&A first, only now getting to proper integrations on culture, tech 
          * often much slower than the _acquired_ party would wish
  * Disconnect between tech press & geeks vs GRPN: your mom loves it, not you.
  * In China, referral traffic from e-mail is virtually nonexistent &#8211; bad for models optimised around that channel

**OB278 &#8211; Organizational Behaviour (Flynn)**

  * Organizational repairs (from Heath, Larrick and Klayman paper &#8211; [PDF here][21]) 
      * Motivational: increase energy and enthusiasm with which individuals pursue a task
      * Cognitive: improve the mental procedures individuals use to pursue a task
  * Very good article by Malcolm Gladwell on dotcom boom era tech sector hiring and effectiveness of interviews in the process: [The New-Boy Network][22]
  * Dinner party guest list rule: every person invited should know half of everyone else &#8211; creates minimum necessary sense of familiarity, yet enough new acquaintances and interesting conversations
  * Deal junkies vs commitment persons in VC industry: always looking for the next hot thing or preferring to work with investments already made
  * Pipeline volume for Heidi Roizen (Softbank): 10 incoming plans a day, 1 in 50 invested, 2h per day spent on feedback to declined proposals (to build and maintain relationships for the future)
  * Movie as a persuasion case study: [12 Angry Men][23] 
      * Full movie on YouTube: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0NlNOI5LG0>
  * Quick straw-polling of initial stand before discussion 
      * many juries do that even when explicitly asked _not to_
      * can enforce group think
      * at the same time &#8211; polarises votes for both sides
      * intends to create a baseline, &#8220;could we get out of here easy if it happens we all agree anyway&#8221;
  * Partipants divide their positions into dichotomy 
      * if I choose A (guilty), I believe 100% he is guilty
      * THEREFORE those who choose B (not guilty) must believe he is 0% guilty
      * this allows for strategy introducing doubt: 
          * convince A&#8217;s that they should vote B-s even if they have 99% belief in guilty
          * reduce the gap from 100 -> 1 unit only
          * much more doable than talking black to white
  * Spotlight is on minority opinion who needs to explain 
      * majority not compelled to say anything
      * minority needs to work (questions) to get their arguments out
  * When introducing a counterargument 
      * solidify the schema you are attacking (show evidence that supports it)
      * THEN break it with your argument for maximum impact
      * Knife argument example in the movie:
    
    {{< youtube RNs6yZ78Ik4 >}}</li> 
    
      * When casting a re-vote, pick the question posed carefully to make it easier to change sides 
          * instead of just &#8220;guilty or not&#8221; -> &#8220;if everyone thinks guilty, we are done&#8221; (fatal) & &#8220;if someone still feels not guilty, we discuss a bit more&#8221; (less committing)
      * Foot in the door 
          * enter with a non-controversial ask: &#8220;do you like puppies?&#8221;
          * follow-up with the real ask: &#8220;can we put a 2m puppy statue in your yard for a few weeks&#8221;?
          * experiments 
              * compliance grows 17% -> 76% after the person agrees to the non-controversial lead
              * &#8220;can you fill in this survey&#8221; vs &#8220;can I ask you a favour? &#8211; yes &#8211; can you fill in this survey?&#8221;: 54% -> 87%
      * Demonstrations are extremely effective 
          * underused because speakers (esp higher raking!) assume the audience expects from them conclusion, analysis and opinion, rather than the display of the path that took them there
          * to lay the foundation for your demo, ask the audience to state/confirm the underlying facts
      * Emotional contrast 
          * people who control the _equilibrium_ (tone, emotion, pace, etc) of the argument win
          * emotion is a divergence from equilibrium
          * when using emotion for contrast: the switches are more powerful in a bouquet 
              * calm discussion -> emotional reaction to someone&#8217;s behaviour -> switch back to calm discussion
          * lack of response to someone else&#8217;s outburst un-validates it 
              * option: stay completely quiet until it becomes awkward
              * the silence forces the emotional side to cool and start offering concessions to break the silence
      * Case: [Heidi Roizen][24] 
          * saying &#8220;no&#8221; well: 
              * consistency (over time: predictability)
              * &#8220;no, because…&#8221; 
                  * most people don&#8217;t bother the additional effort investment to explain
                  * explanation leaves room for re-engagements (asked can come back after fixing a few issues)
              * protect the key nodes in your network from overflow
          * strongest predictor of future relationship: anxiety of first meeting 
              * does this person make you comfortable or not?
              * what can you do to increase comfort of the first meeting&#8217;s context?
      * Informal networks 
          * people feel bad asking and good giving 
              * a self-motivator to get yourself over the natural tendency to not as (= be greedy, incompetent, &#8230;): it opens doors for others to give (help, information, feedback…; = feel good)
              * successful transaction, no matter how small, builds basis for future relationship
          * asking open-ended questions feels more appropriate (less pushy, leaves discretion & room for the others) 
              * yet, research shows more specific asks get more response
          * wrong to assess &#8220;can this question be answered in this group&#8221; and self-censor based on that 
              * secondary contacts/networks are mathematically much larger than any present one
          * physical proximity (ex: office layout) still a major network efficiency driver despite of all the tech improvement 
              * people are lazy.</ul> 
    
    **CS207 &#8211; Software Economics (Wiederhold)**
    
      * Of all intangible assets, _intangible property_ is only the part that is _owned_ 
          * Property: patents, copyright (US: both federal protection), trade secrets (US: state protection varies)
          * Not property: customer loyalty, employee competence
      * Discount rates for risk: 15% (on top of interest) is a low end for well functioning, established software companies
      * Need for maintenance -> enables long-term income 
          * Software set apart from other intangibles 
              * unlike some other IP, ex: a book on 16th century explorers
          * IEEE definitions for maintentance drivers: 
              * Corrective: bugfixing
              * Adaptive: externally driven (underlying OS changes, API/interface changes)
              * Perfective: (growing/changing customer expectations
      * &#8220;Standard bodies are very hard to manage because you need people who are both smart _and_ patient. Rare combination.&#8221;
