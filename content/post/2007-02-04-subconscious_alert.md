I was driving around the city and got stuck behind a bus. Continued to think my thoughts until in about 5 minutes I felt somewhat disturbed. Took a more careful look at the bus&#8217; rear and realized the &#8220;serial number&#8221; there was exactly the same as a 4-digit PIN code I use the most! Hope you understand why this is my first mobile blog post without a photo of the PIN, in big bold numbers. ðŸ™‚

Weird how the brain triggered a subconscious personal privacy alert before I even consciously read the number. More so, I have never seen or written the number down before.
