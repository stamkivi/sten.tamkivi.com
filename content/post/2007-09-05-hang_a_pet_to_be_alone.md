A creative &#8220;do not disturb&#8221; door sign at the [La Bergère Design Hotel][2] in Maastricht, the Netherlands. The next step could be hanging small live animals on a doorknob?
  
This is by far not the only trick they play in that place to justify the &#8220;design&#8221; part of the name. However, randomized door numbering on a floor can get quite annoying if you are really tired and would prefer to actually find your room.
