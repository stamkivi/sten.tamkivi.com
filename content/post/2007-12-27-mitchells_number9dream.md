][1] 
  
The way I met this book is quite as bizarre and coincidental as [David Mitchell][2]&#8216;s writing itself. I happened to finger through a flight magazine (probably SAS, and probably Copenhagen-London) and stumbled on a brief book review of something that sounded like &#8220;fast-paced cyberfiction set in modern Tokyo&#8221;. Given my childhood love for anything [cyberpunk][3] and that I was just [freshly under Tokyo influence][4], I really wanted to get that book. Alas, I immediately forgot the title.
  
Weeks later, I was walking down Market Street in downtown San Francisco, to get my rental car from a parking lot and drive to SFO to fly out. I passed a small bookstore and somehow the memory of that review crawled out from the back of my brain. I entered the store, still clueless on what to look for and spent probably half an hour googling various combinations of &#8220;tokyo dream 9 nine cyber fiction&#8221; type search strings on my Blackberry. Once I finally found the name of Mitchell, I also found the M-shelf with the last copy of the book.

number9dream][1] is all about this sort of seemingly coincidental events by themselves, set physically and situationally well apart, but building up to a great storyline of Eiji&#8217;s quest to find his father from the faceless concrete maze of Tokyo. There is a hint of technology playing it&#8217;s part (as it is in our lives), but it is not pure cyberfiction per se (if that&#8217;s what would scare you away from reading it).
  
If I could think of the most kliché-ridden way of describing the stylistic mix, I&#8217;d say that number9dream is [William Gibson][5] meets [Lost][6] meets [Robert Ludlum][7] meets [Kazuo Ishiguro][8] meets your favourite yakuza manga and then a black and white Japanese 2nd World War movie to top.
  
Mitchell&#8217;s command of detail and dialogue is stellar and his time spent as an Englishman in Japan brings a distinct angle of knowledgeable but still a bit distant outsider reporting to the whole thing. The only thing this book could live without is the sidestory of Goatwriter, which feels like an artificially attached showoff of Mitchell&#8217;s ability to also switch easily from minimalistic japanese translations to archaic few dozen syllable phrase constructs of a victorian fairytale.
  
**VERDICT:**
  
Must read.
