It used to be that you had to be lucky enough to live in one of the [eight countries of Hutchinson&#8217;s 3 network][1] to use the &#8220;official&#8221; version of Skype on a [3 Skypephone][2] handset.

That option is still there, but the world has gotten smaller again for those of us elsewhere, say in [Elbonia][3]. If you are a Skype user and have one of [these 50 mobile handset models][4] (more on the way), just go and [download a client now][5]. Presence, chat, Skype to Skype and SkypeOut calls &#8212; the works &#8212; land in your pocket.

I usally don&#8217;t replicate the [official product announcements from Skype&#8217;s blog][6], but this specific one is definitely in the Top3 things my friends have asked for over the past years. So, please enjoy.
