A very rough summary of travel statistics from 2006, excluding vacations (ahem, those were not there much anyway):

  * Number of business trips: ~30
  * Flight legs: ~70
  * Days away from home: ~70
  * London: ~25 days
  * Luxembourg: ~7 days
  * San Jose/Santa Cruz: 6 days
  * Shanghai: 5 days

  * Number of countries visited (excluding airports): ~13
  * Most active month: May &#8211; 10 countries in 33 days
  * SAS Eurobonus miles collected since August: 53000+

This is an obvious occasion to say thanks to Ede and Kusti for being so understanding about this madness. If anything, 2007 will hopefully be bit lighter on short intra-European cityhopping. Thank you in advance as well!

**UPDATE:** Apparently, having a geeky overview of your travel statistics over time is [one of those geeky things we do][1] at Skype&#8230;
