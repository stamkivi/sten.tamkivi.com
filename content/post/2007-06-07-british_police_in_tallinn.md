When I read from the papers that 15 policemen specializing on football hooliganism were invited to help Estonian police over the days of the Estonia-England game, I imagined them to be some suits in an office, &#8220;consulting&#8221; the local officials.
  
Actually there were the good old black helmets walking in the Old Town Tallinn, stopping by the English supporter groups at open air pubs and chatting with them. Probably they have a bit more experience on how to communicate with a bluecollar bloke from Sheffield after his 8th pint under the belt. Plus the visual effect of merging cultures. Quite a smart trick.
