### Stanford GSB Sloan Study Notes, Week 4, Autumn quarter

Covered in this issue:

  * How Confucius helps the Chinese to consume free MP3s
  * How a CEO is stuck between the Board and his team in a complex matrix of conflicting loyalties
  * How a side-effect of managing a few trillion dollars in your funds is the need to do a lot of board voting for your shares
  * How high-profile VCs can keep your loans in the bank and close your hires
  * How startups should tell their story the way seen in Shrek
  * How to make the devil&#8217;s advocate a resident part of participatory decision making culture
  * How citizens should break the government monopoly of environmental and pollution mapping

And here on to the full notes:<!--more-->

**STRAMGT279 &#8211; Global Strategic Management (Roberts)**

  * Biologists have found far more genetic variation exists _within _any population than across populations 
      * Within-population component of genetic variation 93..95%, only remaining 5-7% ascribed to region-specific differences
      * Article: [Genetic Structure of Human Populations, Science 2002][1]
  * Cultural difference/misunderstanding examples with China 
      * Many Westerners assume Confucius was a religious figure &#8211; actually a senior civil servant in 6th century BC 
          * [Five Confucian virtues][2]
          * Book: [The Analects (Oxford World&#8217;s Classics)][3]
      * [Sun Tzu][4] & his [The Art of War (History and Warfare)][5]
      * Derived from the historic backdrop above, three concepts stringy present in modern Chinese culture 
          * [guanxi][6] (good connections): when each of two people can assume that each is committed to the other
          * __[_mien-tzu_ ][7](face): &#8220;confidence society has in one&#8217;s moral character&#8221;
          * _renqing_ (personal obligations): accrued from past _quanxi_ relationships
      * Copyright culture and beliefs in China &#8211; Confucian principle: &#8220;I transmit, rather than create; I believe in and love the Ancients&#8221; 
          * Book: [To Steal a Book Is an Elegant Offense: Intellectual Property Law in Chinese Civilization (Studies in East Asian law, Harvard University)][8]
  * Hugo Chavez on populism: &#8220;the voice of the people that is being heard&#8221;
  * In high power-distance countries MBO does not work: negotiations are not valid
  * When implementing change, find people who are already moving in the right direction and &#8220;create heroes&#8221; out of them 
      * simplest form: employee of the month
      * works only in individualistic cultures
      * for collectivist cultures, pay works better than non-pay motivators
  * People in individualistic cultures feel guilt, collectivists: shame
  * Falling unionisation (~10-15% of all workers today) as a reflection of growing individualism in US
  * Hofstede&#8217;s data problem: IBM centric, even if framework holds, GLOBE is more rigorous
  * Corporate cultures raise over national ones ([Ohmae][9]) or remain rooted in home culture ([Peter Diamond][10])
  * When measuring cultural distance, borders are 1000-s miles thick
  * Hard to distinguish culture vs competence 
      * &#8220;we do things differently here&#8221; is a great cover for just bad performance
  * [Porter&#8217;s Five Forces][11]: &#8220;who can squeeze you?&#8221; 
      * substitutes, suppliers, customers (usually: next step in value chain), potential entrants, rivals
      * slicing the PIE (Potential Industry Earnings) &#8211; who has the power in given negotiation?
  * New industries are usually born as vertically integrated companies (electricity, broadcasting, computers, …) and break up later
  * Power decisions are often made when someone let&#8217;s a component brand to be visible in their product 
      * Shimano on bikes
      * Google logo on maps (everywhere besides iPhone)
      * &#8220;Intel inside&#8221;
      * grows consumer knowledge of and desire for specific components

Note: see also a separate post for [a toolkit for quick&#8217;n&#8217;dirty country/culture comparison frameworks, books and sites][12].

**GSBGEN566 &#8211; Real-Life Ethics (Mark Leslie, Peter Levine)**

Guest lecturer: [Andy Rachleff][13] of [Benchmark Capital][14]

  * Book: [The Entrepreneur&#8217;s Guide to Business Law][15] (the chapter on Forming & Working with the Board) 
      * Outsiders independents should outnumber insiders on the board
      * Have at least one director of the same generation as the likely successor to the CEO &#8211; when the transition takes place, he or she will have a peer on the board.
      * Having the founders counsel on the board could result in inadvertent waiver of attorney-client privilege
      * Although a diverse board is ideal, it is important to avoid creating a board that acts like a legislature, with each director focused on champi- oning his or her own constituency.
      * Executive search firms, including [Spencer Stuart][16], [Korn Ferry][17], and [Heidrick & Struggles][18], routinely publish data about trends in director compensation
      * Assuming a schedule of quarterly meetings, board work would comprise about eight days of a director&#8217;s year. 
          * As a reflection of time commitment alone, board honoraria could be calculated at 2 to 3 percent of a CEO&#8217;s annual salary.
  * &#8220;You can create a Vice-Chairman role [for a fired CEO]… but the only issue is that everyone in the world knows this is not a real job for a real man&#8221;
  * CEO can be _friendly_, but not _friends_ with his staff
  * &#8220;In senior roles, getting fired without a cure period just comes with the territory&#8221;
  * Palace revolts: a juncture when the leader has lost legitimacy 
      * you can&#8217;t lead without consent
      * could be a reason for CEO departure in itself
  * CEO/board legally protected from mistakes if the are _informed_ and _apply business judgement_
  * When a loan can&#8217;t be _reasonably_ repaid, the board&#8217;s legal loyalty goes to the creditors
  * How long do you give a CEO to find a working business model? 
      * in calendar months?
      * in cash runway left?
      * in product cycles? 2-3?
      * is there follow-through on previous ideas or does he keep flipping to new ones all the time?
  * &#8220;When you think of how thin the labor market is for senior hiring… then you start making really bad decisions&#8221;
  * &#8220;If the CEO has to be told [by the board] what to do, he is not the CEO&#8221;
  * CEO-COO structure very complex to maintain, rather avoid 
      * In some circles it is an intelligence test: &#8220;would you want to be the COO?&#8221; 
          * great people want to be CEOs
          * most high-end recruiters don&#8217;t take COO hiring jobs
      * Outstanding VPs want to report to CEO, not COO
      * Common for the structure to blow up in 2 years (VP-s try to skip level to CEO, when the CEO overrides the COO for the first time: the COO is effectively dead)
  * For a VC to return 0X or 1X of the money is virtually indifferent in the big picture (failure anyway) 
      * wouldn&#8217;t use much partner time to really make the effort
  * Venture partnerships have no board, all partners have fiduciary duty 
      * Who does a partner sitting on the invested company&#8217;s board have fiduciary duty to then? 
          * From the moment you take that board seat, it is to the company
          * VC partners can vote against you (for a fund decision), but you have to vote _for the company_
  * Venture loans: venture in good times and just a loan in tough times 
      * &#8220;possession is 9/10 of the law&#8221; &#8211; on the dynamics of calling back loans
      * when venture debt is in your bank account and bank sweeps it, you can argue all you want, but you don&#8217;t have the cash to burn
      * &#8220;life is a game of chicken&#8221; &#8211; if a bank sees high-profile VCs investing and on board, they are less likely to call the startup&#8217;s loans
  * Past friendship / recommendation is a &#8220;sunk cost&#8221;: your loyalty to company shouldn&#8217;t be influenced by if you brought in the violator or not
  * When is &#8220;purposeful deception&#8221; OK and not OK in business? 
      * bluffing in negotiations?
      * using company time for finding new job?
      * presenting 3-year revenue projections on an untested idea to get funding?
      * asking your friends to &#8220;like&#8221; and &#8220;share&#8221; your newly launched web-based product, even if they are not users? 
          * paying them to do so?

**Investment Club**

Guest speaker: Michael Latham, Chairman of [iShares][19] (part of [Blackrock][20])

  * Fund management activity for ETFs is mostly the same as mutual funds: rebalancing, reinvesting dividends, liquidity management 
      * a lot of investor management overhead (account management, reporting) is offloaded to brokers
      * downside: 10M iShares &#8220;clients&#8221;, but don&#8217;t know who they are
  * High-yield fixed income products are so profitable for broker/dealers that they are resisting ETF transparency more… but it will come
  * Vanguard (fastest growing competitor) is a non-profit established in a spirit of mutual insurance firms
  * ETFs have massive tax advantage in the US (much less taxable capital gains while holding)
  * Blackrock 
      * invented index funds in 1971
      * $3.5 trillion under management
      * as a side-effect has a lot of board voting to do 
          * dedicated proxy team
          * usually votes with the management &#8211; more returns!
      * $500/$700M of success fees from macro bets, not stock picking 
          * latter hard to scale & keep consistent alpha
  * Endowments use ETFs to express specific economic views (countries, sectors they believe are outperforming) 
      * due to quick implementation works for tactical moves too
  * In Europe, banks tangle advice and their own products 
      * Like US was 15 years ago
      * Regulatory pressure to separate (US, NED, SUI next?)
  * Continued role of human market makers is to manage cash flow in high volatility situations 
      * Most algorithms just step aside
      * As a result, market orders fall through the floor (e.g never place a market order)
  * Private wealth markets follow institutions with 5-10 year lag 
      * Institutions 50% passive, retail still 20% &#8211; growth oppty
      * 10y ago, 85% of wealth had advice
      * Now: get advice for your first $10M… but if you have $20-30M more, manage it yourself

**MS&E 472 &#8211; **[Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders][21]

Guest: [Geoff Yang][22] of [Redpoint Ventures][23]: Timing Matters

  * &#8220;Now or never&#8221; is a myth &#8211; learn on someone else&#8217;s nickel if you can
  * Entrepreneur makes an investment in his most valuable things: time, energy & reputation 
      * The VC &#8211; it is for the most part only money
  * You rarely get the driving passion of the entrepreneur in a single meeting: dinners, sporting, meeting family &#8211; whatever you can do more
  * Winners recognize patters where others see chaos
  * You have to be able to _articulate_your conviction clearly 
      * you don&#8217;t have much more in the beginning
      * &#8220;to will a company into existence&#8221;
  * <http://bluefinlabs.com/> &#8211; (almost) real-time big data analysis on how people are reacting to TV
  * <http://electricimp.com/> &#8211; internet of things (by iPhone HW & Google SW engineers)
  * Your solution should be 10X the performance and -3X the price of anything out there to really redefine/create a market (30X improvement)
  * Raise what you need to get to the next milestone: proof pays by increasing valuation for next round 
      * Raising too much works against being lean (culturally, getting just a bit lazier, etc)
  * Hiring 
      * Use your VC&#8217;s credibility (their past successes, confidence to put their money & reputation behind you) to close candidates
      * Hire after growth, always have just a little bit of &#8220;not enough people&#8221;
      * A-list talent over B-experience

[**Mastery of Communications Initiative**][24]** seminar**

Guest Speaker: [James Buckhouse][25] &#8211; Twitter corporate marketing, former Dreamworks storyteller (Shrek, Madagascar)

  * storytelling is all about getting the character from _original state_ to _transformational state_ 
      * in every funny scene, a Shrek character starts happy and ends angry/sad or vice versa
      * how matters much less
  * optimize for repeatability 
      * there is a difference between &#8220;did you like this&#8221; and &#8220;would you recommend this&#8221; question on test surveys
      * first test screenings of Madagascar were loved by targets, but they would not recommend it to other parents (borderline jokes)
  * ghostwriting for Snoop Dogg: you create the story, not \_how\_ the professional delivers it, that is their art
  * say what you do in 4 words. Not 5 or 6. 
      * Twitter &#8220;instantly connects people everywhere&#8221;
  * story is the shortest line between a human need and how your product solves it
  * pro-tip to fix audio: sleeping bag over your head
  * pro-tips to fix video: 
      * get the subject off the wall: in the doorway, in the middle of the room with blurred background
      * move the &#8220;lower 3rd&#8221; (subtitles, name tags) up: TV-era inertia, in mobile/internet there are video scroller controls, etc hiding content there
      * thumb-face rule: is the face of any important character at least the size of your thumb when viewed on mobile screen
      * check for tangents (&#8220;accidental antlers&#8221;)
  * research shows color association is there (red=conflict, love) but so dependent on cultural context, that it doesn&#8217;t matter that much in the end 
      * consistency is more important: you can use brown to mark female in your design, as long as you always do that
  * &#8220;$3 contributions&#8221; a dream outcome for political speechwriter: a proven vote gained
  * Romney&#8217;s &#8220;binders full of women&#8221; meme immediately [surfaced in amazon prod reviews for binders][26]
  * Pitch is an invitation to a co-ride

**OB278 &#8211; Organizational Behaviour (Flynn)**

  * Pre-meeting preferences proven to be excellent predictor of team decision outcome &#8211; why have meetings?
  * Empirical research on when leaders (should) use decision making mechanisms of different levels of participation and what is their impact: Leadership and Decision Making ([Victor H. Vroom][27])
  * Common information problem: groups discuss things that >1 person knows about 
      * we&#8217;re hardwired against &#8220;collective wisdom&#8221; &#8211; new, singular views never make it to the table
      * Solve: ask every participant contribute their info, consolidate and share back _before_ the meeting
  * Whiteboarding _triggers_sharing, besides just helping to visualise 
      * &#8220;let&#8217;s just fill this thing up,&#8221; replaces subconcious guarding the information
      * reduces filters applied
  * Movie: [Thirteen Days][28] on collective decision making in Cuban Missile Crisis 
      * Kennedy left the forum to avoid seniority filters
  * Some senior leaders join meetings only for last 10 minutes 
      * Doesn&#8217;t pollute the open arguments inside team before their arrival
      * Still present / accountable for decisionmaking
      * Saves their time
  * Invite outsiders to your meetings periodically 
      * Second viewpoints
      * &#8220;dinner guest&#8221; creates best behaviours in the team
  * Concious use of &#8220;devils advocate&#8221; role in decision making 
      * Rotate the role &#8211; people will start hating the person
      * Tenure committee culture: your credibility raises if you&#8217;re good playing the devil&#8217;s advocate 
          * Legitimate due to _routine_ (every single time) and _obligatory_ (has to, not wants to argue against) nature
          * &#8220;always first 15 minutes, by 2nd most senior person present&#8221;
  * For tough decisions, schedule a &#8220;second chance&#8221; meeting, _before_ the first one happens, leaving a marinating break in between

**CS547: Human-Computer Interaction Seminar**

Note: full archive of [videos for this course available here][29].

Guest speaker: [Bill Griswold, UC San Diego: CitiSense &#8211; Always-on Participatory Sensing for Air Quality][30]

  * Book: [The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us To Choose Between Privacy And Freedom?][31] (David Brin, 1998): everyone should be wearing sensors to a) level the playing field and b) watch the watchers 
      * Even so, the government measurements will never get hyperlocal, esp inside your home or office
      * Incentives for public measurements with unknown incentives: if high pollution areas get no new highway funding, they tend to be provide very averaged, spike-less, low numbers
  * [CitySense][32] 
      * on body components: temperature, humidity, barometric, 3 electrochemical gas sensors connecting to an app on a phone
      * stores & processes readings, maps your environmental exposure during the day
      * redundancy of readings is a waste of energy &#8211; environment changes slowly 
          * several people travelling together &#8211; can detect and under sample (for ex: prefer loading the user with more battery)
          * use cell communications only when there is something interesting to report back
      * Real-time aspect made people seek pollution sources (&#8220;arriving here CO2 peaked &#8211; and I realised that several city buses pause here with engines on&#8221;)
  * New class of mobile apps that _connect people to their environments_, rather than remove them from it 
      * CitiSense: people first look up to see what causes readings, but even more so: start sharing their readings naturally with people nearby: my exposure is your exposure

**CS207 &#8211; Software Economics (Wiederhold)**

  * In combined licence sales / maintenance model, detecting a moment when to drop maintenance for an old version can be misleading 
      * Right time when the (maintenance) cost exceeds _sales_ income, yet it is tempting to continue while maintenance income covers it
  * Paradox of maintenance spending: SW maintenance grows more expensive along with size of codebase & complexity, yet it makes logical sense to spend less (as a share of income) the closer the retirement of this SW is
  * Complex liability setups from (lack of) maintenance &#8211; who should pay if a person dies for maltreatment? 
      * A medical information system built on an ancient OS. The medical SW provider is against an OS upgrade, because they could be liable for damages if their software doesn&#8217;t perform. Yet the OS provider has deceased maintenance and the OS is actually _more_ risky for viruses, hardware upgrades, etc
  * [Vilfredo Pareto][33] was a railroad entrepreneur
