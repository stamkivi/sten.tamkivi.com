[Saul][1] published [his slides][2] from the [NextWeb][3] conference.
  
We had a good lunch with him a few months ago on the philosophical topic of [supporting the seeding European ventures][4] (and [OpenCoffee][5] as one of the tools for that).
  
I would have loved to hear him on stage of course, but still the deck provides some pointers for further thought or at least some reassurance against the skeptics out there thinking that there is no chance for tech success outside the Valley, or at least not on this side of the pond. There is, watch and see. Or do.
