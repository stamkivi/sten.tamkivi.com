Speak of coincidences &#8211; or a pileup of pressure: over the weekend one topic came up (as it does in a recurring way) with a group of classmates, yesterday there was this article ([The Anxiety of the Unanswered E-Mail][1]) making social media rounds and to top it off, [Dave & Jason were having a ping-pong on usage of auto-responders][2] on Twitter today (also see the [Quora thread][3] for context).

By &#8220;the topic&#8221; I mean the ever-worsening pain: humans&#8217; inability to cope with their email load (and what the cultural implications of that are). As someone whose Mail client showed the following unread counts (aka &#8220;unprocessed&#8221;, really, in my personal methodology), I am obviously part of this global problem:

The shame of not answering in time (or ever) used to follow me for years, and the sorrow of not getting responses to many e-mail I send was there too, as a counter-punishment. I say &#8220;used to&#8221; and &#8220;was&#8221;, because it really does not any more.

Back in 2010 I scripted the following auto-responder message that for a while went out in return for every single incoming e-mail:

> Hello,
> 
> I have adopted a new &#8212; if I may say, &#8220;zen&#8221; &#8212; approach to e-mail.
> 
> Imagine me as a buddhist monk sitting on the bank of a mighty river, watching the thousands of weekly messages flow by. Several times a day I reach into the river and fish out a dozen or a few of them. Others swim by unstopped as there is no way I could fetch them all. Yet, deep down inside I know that the messages that really need to find me, will. One day.
> 
> However, if you&#8217;d like to be more sure of my timely response to your message, please add me on Skype. My Skype name is &#8220;sten&#8221; and I&#8217;m increasingly online via our desktop and mobile clients (<http://www.skype.com/intl/en/get-skype/>).
> 
> Talk soon,

In a few weeks some of my frequent correspondents got too annoyed and I reconsidered the &#8220;auto&#8221; part: generating 1:1 matches for every incoming e-mail doesn&#8217;t help towards solving the overload for anyone, unfortunately. But 3 years later I still happily stand by the contents of this message for the most part, with a few comments and clarifications learned since:

  * My diligence and discipline of getting back to people on Skype chat is still far better than e-mail, but there still is no universal conversation management tool for all. In business environment there was more convergence and control, but being back at school I need to juggle people and groups whose preference of communication channels can also vary between Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Kakaotalk, GroupMe&#8230; Each context switch runs the risk of reducing response rates further.
  * One thing for sure, e-mail is still part of this attention portfolio, but not _it_. The occasional excitement about some new UX paradigm with the promise to be more effective in handling e-mail comes and goes, but for example when the Mailbox app makes me swipe a few hundred (or 17,000?) times on a smaller screen as opposed to arrow-keying around on a larger one &#8211; the productivity benefit is too incremental to really win a notable share of my day or toolkit.
  * Most importantly: it is pointless to be mad at people who don&#8217;t respond to you in expected time, if at all. 95% of the cases that piss you off would be just a [fundamental attribution error][5] in action (assigning blame not on situation but on character). If it burns, ask again. And better yet &#8211; think what you can do to make your first message as easily actionable as you can: short, crisp, with a clear action ask or response expectation, if any.

Or, as the author concludes on a very constructive note in that NYT piece:

> <p itemprop="articleBody">
>   So, here’s my idea. Those of us waiting for replies shouldn’t be so quick to leap to negative conclusions. It’s unlikely your best friend suddenly hates you. Or you’ve alienated a co-worker. Reach out again.
> </p>
> 
> <p itemprop="articleBody">
>   And to those who habitually don’t respond, try sending a quick e-mail just to say you can’t answer now. And if you really mean no, say no. Most of us can handle rejection. We just can’t handle not knowing.
