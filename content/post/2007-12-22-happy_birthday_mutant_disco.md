Last night the [Von Krahl theater][2] in Tallinn hosted crowds from all over the past ten years to cheer for the tenth birthday of [Mutant Disco][3].
  
As for many other good things in this category, we have to thank again late [John Peel][4]. By becoming a fan of [Röövel Ööbik][5] and giving them a lot of BBC One airtime in early nineties, he inevitably helped to build a strong network between the Estonian and UK music circles, with the now inseparable tandem of [Raul Saaremets][6] & Chris &#8220;[Rythm Doctor][7]&#8221; Long to start with.
  
MD has been so much more than another club event here. It has consistently exposed local and international top performances to the scene, shaping our tastes and values. Bringing guys like [Bob Jones][8] or [Frankie Valentine][9] or [Basement Jaxx][10] or [Moodymann][11] over to a tiny cold Northern European capital must have been extremely hard for Raul and Chris when they started, but hugely because of their pains of the early years, Estonia has become the vibrant alternative music and culture host it is now. There is a video interview with them available on how they got started (mostly in Estonian): [part 1][12] and [part 2][13].
  
Over the years, MD has innovated with not just music, but also with consistent branding, their web presence and active online community around md.com forums, creative flyers (first on paper, fully virtual these days), redefining Von Krahl from a theatre to happening, multifaceted event location, etc etc.
  
But most importantly, Mutant Disco has had an unprecedented effect on building a strong horizontal network inside a certain generation of our small country. Many in their student years gathering to Mutant Discos 10 years ago are now the who&#8217;s who stars of business, investment banking, government, law, technology, media and many others making things happen in arts &#8211; music, literature, visual arts, cinema, fashion. In the mixed nostalgic-euphoric vibe at the event yesterday, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder what extremely unique value has been created just because of the out of the box mindsets people end up with here. A successful attorney hanging out with music critics or a software developer with his best friends in experimental video think much differently than their colleagues stuck in narrow professional groups of their industry. The experience of belonging to the diverse group of mutants must have released ideas and energy in places we don&#8217;t even admit.
  
Respect, Raul & Chris, and happy birthday again!
