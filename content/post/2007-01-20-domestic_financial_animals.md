We have all been convinced by media, American Psycho and personal experience that you can recognize successful bankers from their expensive suits &#8212; or at least really smart casual wear &#8212; and all-n-all sharp looks no matter what the hour. From Lower Manhattan to London City to &#8230; well, I guess, [Pegasus][2] in the Old Town, Tallinn.
  
Please meet Priit and Andres. As any good member of the financial circles would, they _really_ do dress up before meeting their colleagues on a Saturday night.
  
Healthy. I really feel safe trusting my money with these guys.
