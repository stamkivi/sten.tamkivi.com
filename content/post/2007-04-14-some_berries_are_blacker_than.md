After the [recent odysseia][1] of fixing my broken mobile communications I&#8217;ve now solved the written comms part as well. I&#8217;ve joined what some consider the forces of evil and landed on a [BlackBerry 8800][2].

<!--more-->

To be honest, I was in the no-BB party only a few weeks ago myself. Mainly due to the sad fact that colleagues using BBÂ´s have a proven tendency to use Skype multichats much less and fall back to extremely short and frequent e-mail communication. And e-mail, per se, is evil. Spam, weak threading, unauthorized contacts, lack of presence & security &#8212; to name a few major flaws.

For me a tilting comment to at least try came from NZ, who in an informal &#8220;BlackBerry &#8211; _pro_ or _contra_&#8221; argument reminded of the early mobile phonecall times, when most people found very much normal to run around for a payphone and think of the first owners of very expensive mobile devices as weirdos. And where are we now? Speaking to a gadget on a street is normal, mobile phone penetrations in different countries exceed the population. But for data comms, a cafe with a wifi hotspot and and a full notebook is viewed more &#8220;normal&#8221; than a tiny keyboard in a cab. 

So, for me this is not just a gadget switch, but a test of personal strenght to avoid going back to the [memorable 1000-email-days][3]. Of course, a Skype client for BlackBerry would help here a lot. ðŸ™‚

&#8220;Aha!&#8221; impressions after first few days:

  * The thing just works, and this is the most important part. Data comes and goes as intended, much more invisibly and smoothly in the background than I&#8217;ve ever seen with any smartphone/PDA. E-mail, calendar, multiple (personal/corporate) address books, RSS feeds, WAP, HTML. The works.
  * Level of integration between applications is amazingly intuitive. 
      * Call records in same list with e-mails and instant messages
      * Sent mail items in message lists look like checked todo items
      * Navigation from your personal address book to finding one of the seventeen-something-thousand colleagues of whole eBay Inc to seeing the map of their office on screen takes about 20 seconds and 2 clicks.
      * GoogleÂ´s (presumably Java-based) GMail client for BB feels as if it was designed for this device as the central idea.
  * Built in GPS and dynamic maps downloaded on the fly. Elbonia is out of map coverage, as usual (Tallinn has about 2 streets?), but the levels of detail for London or San Jose are great.
  * Ultraslim form factor. Even if the screen is much larger than E70&#8217;s, the device as a whole feels less clunky. Keyboard is more usable than I feared. And the &#8220;pearl&#8221; navigation beats the side-wheel of older BB models I&#8217;ve played with by far.

First nuisances found:

  * Lack of 3G. However, it is only when browsing larger web pages that you even wish that there was more than GPRS/EDGE built in.
  * There is no operator in Estonia supporting BlackBerries yet. Roaming mobile data can be expensive. And if it wasnÂ´t, it would still be quite stupid as a concept. WhatÂ´s stopping you, EMT? 
  * Still have to get (re)used to the multiple device situation. E-mails on one and photos on another. An Estonian and UK phone number. Should drop RSS & web bookmarks on the normal phone.

The geeky thing to still try: bluetooth sync of address books between BB and phone. Supposed result: add/change a phone number in your Outlook and get it automagically in both handsets.

So, we&#8217;ll see how it goes. My e-mail alerts are on silent, in any case, to retain control of my life.
