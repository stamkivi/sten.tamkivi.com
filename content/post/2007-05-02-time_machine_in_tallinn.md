[Tallinn TV tower][1] is a miraculous place. In most elevators the numbers on buttons indicate floors, in this case it must be years the time machine will take you back. As you can see, today you can choose to go back to approximately 170m high (trivia fact: the tower itself is 314m) as it was in 1986.

This is what people ate in 1986 in Soviet Estonia as a fancy dish. [Chicken Kiev][3] is basically a cutlet filled with&#8230; melted butter and herbs. Load of potatoes on the side not pictured.

The view on [Tallinn Botanical Garden][5] for some reason reminded me that I haven&#8217;t started the golf season yet. Wouldn&#8217;t this be a nice location for 18 holes?
