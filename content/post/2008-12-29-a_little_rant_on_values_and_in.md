Found a video of my five minute speech in a panel at [Restart 2008][1] conference in November. To disrupt the overall tone of the day a bit &#8212; focusing on tangible, measurable and often plain numeric aspects of a successful (liberal) macroeconomic environment &#8212; I decided on spot that I will instead talk about the softer side of life, namely the role values and tolerance in particular play for creating an environment where innovation strives in Estonia (or anywhere).

The clip below also has my fellow panelist [Rein Raud][2], Rector of Tallinn University continuing on the same topic of innovation and openness.

Back then, I did my [original conference notes post][3]) in Estonian, but now realized that we actually spoke in English there. So here you go:



For context, please also see the very entertaining and inspirational intro to our panel by [Pekka Roine][4], entitled &#8220;The Only Obstacle to Innovation Is Wrong Policy Chosen by the State&#8221; (videos: [part 1][5], [part 2][6], [part 3][7]).

The rest of the [presentations of the day are available in video too][8], of course.
