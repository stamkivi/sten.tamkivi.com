Duncan&#8217;s lecture &#8220;Talking with Computers: Short stories on usability, interaction and designing Skype&#8221; held yesterday at the [IT College][1] is now [available for your viewing pleasure][2]. (Fastforward past the first part in Estonian)

Really glad he made it despite of a cancelled flight. And guess if his flight back was cancelled as well?
