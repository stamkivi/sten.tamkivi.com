Had a lovely romantic dinner at [Pied รก Terre][2] on Charlotte street in London, a two Michelin star venue run by Shane Osborn. (Trivia fact: he apparently was the first Australian to ever receive a Michelin star recognition in 1999).
  
Everything from the apperative [Apple Martini][3] to the basics of how bread & butter are served was as perfect as the first time I was there about 6 months ago. Highly recommended. The [menu on their website][4] seems to be out of date a bit though, prepare for some (good) surprises when you go. And unless you feel _really_ confident around the two hardcover books of wine lists ([PDF-s available][5]) I recommend letting the _sommelier_ matching them by glass to each dish.
  
The top gourmet experience for me this time: scallop sausages served along the white fish pictured above.
