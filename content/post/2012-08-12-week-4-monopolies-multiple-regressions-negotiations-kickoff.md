### Stanford GSB Sloan Study Notes, Week 4, Summer quarter

Pages assigned for reading: 121 (but quite a few written assignment deadlines)

**POLECON239 &#8211; Strategy Beyond Markets (prof Jha)**

  * US Antitrust regulation (from Baron textbook) 
      * Protecting _competition_ does not mean protecting _competitors_
      * Even though it can seem that most antitrust activity in the US is enforced by strong government interest, in reality 90% of lawsuits filed under federal antitrust laws are brought by _private_ litigants
    
    <!--more-->
    
      * Antitrust activities classification 
          * Horizontal (inside the same industry): monopolisation, predatory pricing, price fixing, bid rigging, allocation of customers, group boycotts
          * Vertical (involving firms in supply arrangement or channel of distribution): allocation of territories by manufacturer among distributors/retailers, refusals to deal, exclusive dealing arrangements, resale price maintenance, reciprocal arrangements, tying (forced bundling). Also, mergers between manufacturers & suppliers/distributors.
      * Monopoly achieved as a result of market forces combined with a superior product (result of &#8220;superior skill, foresight and industry&#8221;) is NOT illegal.
  * Funky US legal system nuances & terms: 
      * Treble damages: if an antitrust suit is filed against a firm by Department of Justice, private parties can run along with private lawsuits to request damages. (DOJ-supporting court decision makes the private follow-ups quite likely wins)
      * Per Se violations: some acts are &#8220;sufficiently egregious&#8221; so that the court doesn&#8217;t even discuss the extent _how_damaging they were. Examples today: price fixing, allocation of customers between competitors are per se violations. 
          * The only defence the defendant can bring is that they did _not_ commit the act at all.
      * Rule of reason: a possibility to evaluate if an act is &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; if literal interpretation of the too sweeping language of antitrust laws would be harmful to competition and efficiency. 
          * The defendant can argue that a) they didn&#8217;t do it at all, or b) it was not unreasonable to behave as they did. For latter, the plaintiff needs to prove otherwise.
  * EU Common Market antitrust regulation 
      * refers to group activities that may limit competition _or constitute a barrier to trade among member states_
      * allows for economic consequences for antitrust violations explicitly (thus no per se violations needed)
      * Article 81 paragraph 3 virtually grants block exemptions for things like exclusive distributorships, exclusive purchase agreements, patent licensing, motor vehicle distribution, specialisation, R&D, franchises and know-how licensing &#8212; all on the basis that firms are obligated to use the least restrictive means to achieve efficiency and some of the efficiency gains need to be passed on to consumers.
      * DG for Competition is both prosecutor and the judge. Courts only enter the picture in case of appeal.
      * EU requires a merger notification from companies registered outside EU, if their _sales_ in EU >100M EUR. (Ex: 2001 EU blocked General Electric + Honeywell merger that 15 countries had approved already)
      * DG for Competition also monitors member states aid to companies and handles other private parties complaints to stop aid.

**MGTECON209 &#8211; Statistics & Economics (prof Oyer)**

  * You want a **reliable **Beta for useful regressions 
      * Standard Error (Beta) = SQRT ( Variance of Residuals / Sum of Squared Deviations of X ) 
          * The bigger the sample in denominator, the smaller the standard error!
      * Tips for picking a useful sample: Beta will be less realiable (SE(Beta) is higher) if 
          * Residuals vary more
          * X-variable varies less
          * Sample size gets smaller
  * p-value makes only a _statistical_ difference, not necessarily in _business_ or _economic_ sense. Don&#8217;t jump to conclusions.

    <strong>OB289 &#8211; Negotiations (prof Neale)</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Basic negotiation errors (Bazerman & Neale textbook) <ul>
        <li>
          You can think of market competition as a form of negotiations between competitors over industry practices (for example pricing). Which in turn can lead to the very same irrational mistakes as in any other negotiation &#8211; for example the &#8220;irrational escalation of commitment,&#8221; where winning the other party <em>on any terms</em> becomes more important than, say, maximising the profits in an industry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Misdirected persistence: decisionmakers are often obsessed by the small probability that escalating the conflict one step further could lead to victory. <ul>
            <li>
              People (esp leaders, politicians) want to look consistent. Persistence, even if irrational, helps to be perceived that way.
            </li>
            <li>
              Organizations need systems to reward good decision making over effective impression management.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Focus on time and money already invested in negotiations (the sunk costs) as an argument, rather than evaluating <em>only</em> the future costs & benefits
        </li>
        <li>
          Reactive devaluation of proposals just because they are made by adversary
        </li>
        <li>
          Attempt to solve singular issues (sometimes &#8220;let&#8217;s start with easy ones&#8221;, sometimes &#8220;the hardest ones&#8221;) instead of issue &#8220;packages&#8221; which allow for more granular compromises & trading
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

**Other thoughs to remember** (no attribution as we just agreed to [Chatham House Rule][1] for in class and for guest presentations):

  * Q: Why would you go establish your China outpost in Beijing, not in Shanghai, Hong Kong or other places with seemingly more livid business scene? A: Because the kind of China many people in the world, and inside China, are hoping to see one day will be a result of decisions made in Beijing.
  * To manage smart people moving between academic research and private industry (e.g working in the Valley), you just have at all times to know and agree on where their _center of intellectual focus_ is. A professor consulting startups for a day a week is fine, but his success is entirely measured by his work on campus &#8211; teaching, researching, publishing, peer & student feedback. When the private sector interest takes over, this should be formed clearly as an academic break, not half-hearted contribution to school. And the person is very eagerly waited to return in a few years, with much more experience from private sector life.
  * &#8220;Sometimes my answer is &#8216;yes&#8217;, sometimes &#8216;no&#8217; and sometimes &#8216;maybe&#8217;. Yet, I never say &#8216;yes&#8217; when I mean &#8216;maybe&#8217;, or &#8216;maybe&#8217; when I really mean &#8216;no&#8217;.&#8221;
