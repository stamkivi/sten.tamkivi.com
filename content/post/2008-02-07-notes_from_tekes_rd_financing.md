On Monday I was in Helsinki, speaking at a seminar organized by [Tekes][1], Finnish funding agency for tech & innovation. They are launching a new generation of integrated startup financing schemes &#8211; which I do not know much about, as my Finnish is below par to fully understand [their published materials][2]. But it was a nice half-day event to provide context around their announcements.

The guest speakers included Dr Orna Berry who shared the Israeli innovation financing experiences, Quatar Capital&#8217;s Mikko Suonelahti&#8217;s talk on venture capital markets. In between them, I was asked to share the story of Skype as a recent startup.

Some of the tonality of Finnish experts, from their Minister&#8217;s opening speech to hallway conversations with people in the audience felt quite weird coming from Estonia. Over here we look up to Finland as a role model in R&D and innovation environment, probably not a single discussion around [Estonian Development Fund][3] goes without mentioning neighboring Tekes, [Sitra][4] and others. However, in Finland, many feel that their progress is not fast enough and they need another boost to get to a next level after the first wave of &#8220;nokias&#8221;.

Below are my unstructured notes from Dr Berry&#8217;s presentation. Leaving aside the enormous impact of military financed R&D which was not discussed this time, I think there are still a few points not just Finland should consider learning from:

  * Israel: Innovation policy from R&D to VC funding 
      * Govmt established Chief Scientist postions 1969 (1 in min of defence, the other civil)
      * Budget to support R&D commercialization &#8211; $0.5B / year in the 80s
      * now smaller, as private sector has picked up
      * no preferred sectors, firms, tech; government attempts no winner picking but neutrality
      * picking winners is _private_ VC&#8217;s art (not science)
      * govmt&#8217;s main vehicle is Matching Grants Program, criteria: 
          * tech and commercial feasibility & merit
          * the neighboring markets don&#8217;t have enough GDP for sustainable exports, so high enough margins for global competitiveness is a must
          * risks
          * potential for expertise generation
          * MGP provides conditional loans up to 50% of R&D cost 
              * ONLY IF the resulting product is succesful, the loan is returned at the rate of 3% of sales / yr
              * NB! this gives also input stats for measuring if country&#8217;s hightech sales rise (tripled in decade in Israel)
      * ISR-US R&D program: $214m grants for 672 projects. direct sales of $4.1B. PLUS indirect gains in created ecosystem.
      * Yozma Program &#8211; incentives for foreing investors (risk guarantees, financial incentives, privatization) 
          * 10 VC funds, $200m raised, $100m from government
          * government sold its share of the funds in &#8217;97
  * Israeli challenge &#8211; second class economy: 
      * 1996-2004, ICT grew 10.5% a year, everything else at 2.3%. 
      * productivity actually DECLINED: transport,construction, retail, business services
      * agressive support in ICT alone will not raise happiness for the whole country
      * taxation
      * ireland, singapore incentivise capital investment; Israel r&d investments more 
      * some foreign investment tax incentives copy the country of origin! if you come from a place where social tax is 20%, you will get the same in Israel, etc.
