I&#8217;ve always hated coins as the most outdated and impractical way to physically represent money, a very virtual concept in itself, especially in the days of electronic banking, chip cards and PayPal accounts. Fortunately [Estonian Kroons][2] are all paper notes in real life. We do have coins, but you rearly use something smaller than a 5 kroon paper note if you pay with cash and do not use cards or [mobile payments][3]. The pocket weight that goes with every trip to London is much worse.
  
However, I never thought of the upside of those annoying coins. The owners of binocular vending machines (for lack of a better idea how to call those) on the shore of Tenerife, Canary Islands have left meeting their revenue forecasts up to the randomness of whatever piece of metal a passing tourist might have in their pocket. Same equipment cost, same &#8220;effort&#8221; but easily doubled revenues if it just &#8230; happens so. Very zen. Try to do that in e-business.
