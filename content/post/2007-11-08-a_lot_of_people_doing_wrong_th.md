An interesting graph from a presentation by Ott PÃ¤rna, CEO of [Estonian Development Fund][2] (see also [my post from their recent event][3], in Estonian). Estonian & German industries being compared here by employment (left) and value added per manufacturing area.
  
One common characteristic we share is that there are a lot of areas where a large share of people is adding a tiny part of the value for country&#8217;s economy. However, it is quite concerning how tilted towards the bottom (= less value) is the distribution of Estonian workforce.
  
It would be very interesting to see service industries in different countries being compared in a similar way &#8211; such as the software, biotech, nanotech and other innovation/R&D fields we talk so much about. Anyone have a good pointer?
  
PS: most value in German manufacturing is added with oil, nuclear fuel and tobacco? Scary&#8230;
