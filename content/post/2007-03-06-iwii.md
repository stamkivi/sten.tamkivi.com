Even though the [numbers seemed funny][1] at the time, it is obvious now that [DS][2] is a much more balanced person than I am. As of last night, my [physical age][3] is 75 and my [brain age][4] 33.

Apparently the lust for (next-gen) gaming does not drop with age and Nintendo does a great job with bringing some appropriate sense into this as a good excuse to find time. (Not an issue with DS _[edit: aha, confusing, meant the [Nintendo DS Lite][5] this time, as opposed to the DS person linked above]_, given the extensive flying on European routes with shrinking seat space often prohibiting you to open a computer).

Thanks a lot for the b-day gifts!
