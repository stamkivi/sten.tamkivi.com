It is obviously the back-to-school-and-work season now.

First: I&#8217;m receiving complaints that this blog has seen just 2 posts in last 2 months&#8230; In July nor August nobody cared, including myself. If you were one of those worried about silence &#8211; I now know that you have not [subscribed to the feed][1]. [My Flickr feed][2] you receive as an automagically embedded freebie when subscribing to this blog, has actually had a full trail of mobile snapshots of what has happened over the summer. And I have [twittered][3].

Secondly, the travel season has started. Looking at the calendar, in the month of September I will drop by Tartu (spoke at [Baltic Dynamics][4] there last week), Pärnu (attending [From Visions to Solutions][5]), London (a wedding + [Seedcamp][6]), Athens (Skype Beta Days), Luxembourg, San Francisco / San Jose.

Hope this is enough chances to see you in person. And if not &#8211; I&#8217;ll try to be a better boy when it comes to dropping a line here on the way. Thanks, your pings to see if I survived the slow season are heartwarming.
