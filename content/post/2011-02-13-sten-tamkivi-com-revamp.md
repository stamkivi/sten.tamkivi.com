With a week of downtime to ponder about things, I also thought about this site and its role in my portfolio of things to maintain.

It has been a year since I posted here and not for the lack of things to say or share but for the much-discussed oncoming of byte-size social media. I&#8217;ve been [posting on Twitter][1] almost daily (and it was fun to rediscover [I wrote about that becoming a trend for me in April 2009 here][2]) and as anyone, hit an occasional Facebook Like button or write a comment to a friend&#8217;s feed.

I still came to a conclusion that a blog has a place for me in my conversations with all of you. And then realized that I&#8217;m basically rephrasing what [Clive Thompson recently said so well in Wired: Tweets and Texts Nurture In-Depth Analysis][3]. It is so weird to think that just a few years ago you had to self-host of blogging engine to share a crappy mobile-quality photo (example: [a typical post from Oct 2005][4]) &#8211; there are so many new and better tools for that. But still, at times you feel like writing more than 140 characters to convey an idea, and do it in a space you actually control.

So, I took a few hours to revamp the software setup sten.tamkivi.com runs on to meet the changed needs. This is what&#8217;s changed:

  * Moved from MovableType to WordPress. Long overdue, but really needed the thinking above to be worth the conversion effort. Also considered [Tumblr][5], [Edicy][6] & [Squarespace][7], but as I already have a [Dreamhost][8] account anyway and WP has been quite painless for our kids&#8217; blog, made this one easy.
  * Refreshed the visual skin that had been eye-hurtingly stuck somewhere in the nineties.
  * Moved comment threads to [Disqus][9]. Just the thought of logging into an admin interface to see another 10,000 spam comments slipping through MT&#8217;s broken filters was discouraging to writing anything. And as I don&#8217;t see in any value in anonymous comments, Disqus let&#8217;s you log in with your existing Facebook and Twitter credentials.
  * Drew my more frequent Twitter activity more visibility into this site.
  * Provided some standard tools to share content from here to social sites &#8211; Twitter, Delicious & Facebook.

So, in a way, as everything else on the interwebs, this blog has been downgraded from being a central portal about what Sten thinks to one of the several repositories of content I produce as I go &#8211; focussing on being simpler, and playing better together with all the other pieces in the puzzle. I am still happy if you choose to [subscribe][10], as at the end of the day &#8211; does any content even exist if it is not read?

Old content wise, most of the archives seem intact, just the permalinks have changed &#8211; I expect Google to reindex them in no time and thus didn&#8217;t bother to rework. One known casualty of conversion were tags &#8211; if anyone has any past experience with that MT->WP, please let me know?

End of the technical interlude and hope for a more regular programming &#8211; I&#8217;ve been overoptimistic about the time needed for that before. Thanks for coming back &#8211; there were over 5000 unique readers here even over the quiet 2010.
