Google started this year with aggressively reviewing its product portfolio. A number of services [were announced to be shut down][1] recently. That&#8217;s fine, times are tough. And even if they were not &#8211; I still admire the decisiveness of any large product company to occasionally merge similar things and kill the ones that haven&#8217;t gained traction. I&#8217;ve had to make a few of those decisions myself and they are never easy.

So when logging in to [FeedBurner][2] a week ago they proposed they merge my feeds into my Google account, it really wasn&#8217;t a surprise. After all FeedBurner had been already [acquired by Google last June][3] and something had to happen some day.

These sort of transitions are bound to introduce glitches, too. So I didn&#8217;t feel like bitching at once, but give it some time. Now, a week after the transition this is becoming a textbook example of how not to merge products if you are not ready.

This is what I as a long time user am struggling with still today, 7 days after:

  * I used to be a paid customer for premium stats services of FeedBurner. It seems for the part they now killed because of the overlap with Google Analytics &#8211; makes sense. However, nowhere in the process have I learned what happened to my credit relationship, will I continue to be charged or not. Not even a note in the lines of &#8220;thanks for your business, now we&#8217;re free&#8221;, if that is the case.
  * The RSS subscribers count for this blog, for example, fell from 271 to 128. It was supposed to &#8220;get adjusted in a week&#8221;, which it has not. And guess what seems to be the issue &#8211; the RSS reader type that seems to have vanished from the stats is&#8230; [Google Reader][4]&#8230;
  * I have been splicing public bookmarks into my feed via [del.icio.us][5]. This does not work any more. When I go to feedburner.google.com settings, the configuration data is still there, but re-saving it displays an error message of &#8220;username stent doesn&#8217;t exist on del.icio.us&#8221;. Which is [not true][6], of course.
  * Splicing photos from [my Flickr feed][7] does not work either, automatically that is. I get a one time effect of images import by going to settings and re-saving the Flickr configuration. But the next time I upload something to Flickr, no automatic feedburner splicing occurs.
  * I often peek at blog stats from my iPhone. iPhone does not support Flash. Thus FeedBurner used to be a well-suited alternative to full [Google Analytics][8] to understand how things are trending, which referrals actively generate traffic, etc. Now, not only is GA Flash-centric enough that you can&#8217;t even select a report date without it (and I&#8217;m yet to see a decent iPhone app for this), they have moved the new FeedBurner to partial Flash too&#8230;
  * Even if it was a geeky and technical service, I&#8217;ve always loved FeedBurner&#8217;s philosophy, brand and language they talk to me in. So I sort of feel I owe them some and have spent a few evening hours trying to get the above feedback back to them. No such luck, virtually responseless [Google Feedburner help group][9] is all there is.

Apologies to all subscribers who are missing content or &#8211; I really don&#8217;t know &#8211; are seeing any other technical difficulties with [this feed][10].
