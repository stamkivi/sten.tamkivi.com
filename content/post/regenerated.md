When my self-hosted Wordpress instance sent me an alarm the other day about everything being broken again due to some PHP upgrade two generations ahead of what I knew existed, I didn't feel like having the time and energy to get into fixing it.

Instead, I took a few nights and looked into the fantastic world of static site generation. Imagine, no PHP, no databases, no out of sync plugins or script exploits.

With the help of [Hugo][1] and a [Wordpress-to-Markdown script][2], everything went surprisingly smoothly.

Skipped all the navigation gimmicks, tag clouds, content categories and such. You probably landed here by search anyway.

So here's just the stuff I wrote a while ago, in the [simplest possible template][3].

If you see a broken image or a missing piece, just please ping [me on Twitter][4], will you please?

PS: If you scroll down far enough, like to 2007, it is fun to see how I used to use a self hosted blog as the "manual Instagram" for the crappy nascent mobile cams, sometimes daily!
