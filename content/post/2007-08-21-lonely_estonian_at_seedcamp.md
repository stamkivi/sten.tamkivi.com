As the [Seedcamp key dates][1] are rolling by and the September week in London is getting closer for the lucky 20, [Saul][2] has been posting some intermediary updates.

My little personal sad news is that [among the 260 applications sent in][3] there was <s>no</s> a single one from Estonia. Hope it was not because the [spreading the word][4] effort was modest ([thanks, guys, for helping on that!][5]) rather because every startup (idea) around here already has enough competence, experience and financing. Wouldn&#8217;t be that nice to believe?

On there more positive side I&#8217;m going to be dropping by the event anyway on September 4th which is the [Going to Market day][6] covering product design and development as well as marketing strategies. It is quite cool to see that there is a notable [group of people from and around Skype going to mentor][7]. Even cooler &#8211; we didn&#8217;t agree on this internally as a Skype &#8220;raid&#8221;, but people are donating their time.

Looking forward to getting to know this wave of best & brightest entrepreneurs in person soon.
