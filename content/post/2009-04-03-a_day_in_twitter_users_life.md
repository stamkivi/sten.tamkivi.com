I&#8217;ve found myself [using Twitter][1] more and more recently. In large part it comes on the expense of blogging here &#8211; the mental entry barrier is so much different from taking proper time out of a busy day to write a polished blog entry versus shooting away compressed 140 character thought-bits from my mobile in the middle of a meeting or in transit when travelling.

I&#8217;ve experimented quite a bit with what I tweet about. At some point I jotted down a few blogging principles ([in Estonian here][2]) and Twitter was initially a channel for the leftovers that didn&#8217;t fit in, e.g. short messages about me, my location, my random inner thoughts &#8211; rather than something specifically designed for the reader. As my [followers count][3] has grown (getting very close to the number of RSS subscribers on this blog &#8211; interesting tipping point soon; now ranking in [the top 2 of #Estonian users][4] &#8211; hi, Cyrus), I&#8217;ve knowingly pulled back from more egocentric and personal stuff and craft my short messages for a broader, more anonymous audience. To a notable extent I&#8217;m also taking feedback from those near and dear to me about which content they feel could be uncomfortable or too revealing.

Either way, Twitter is a concept-stretching medium and part of the beauty of it is that though we more or less know what is the &#8220;old&#8221; stuff that it is changing we can have no clue yet to what, in which direction. Even better, it is still up to us as the users to define it &#8211; both when consuming microcontent (whom we follow, how we filter, what we re-share) and when creating it (just linking or creating new? talking about yourself or the readers? social realism or philosophical abstractionism?).

Anyway, what sparked this post was actually a funny incident today. [Apple App Store][5] opened up for Estonian users today. As we [launched the Skype client for iPhone][6] this week and it has [skyrocketed to a million downloads in less than 48 hours][7], we are all of course very closely following this space right now. So, when I learned about Apple&#8217;s Estonian expansion this morning, I of course tweeted it (at 10:58) as something my followers could care about. At 11:46 Eesti Päevaleht, one of the largest Estonian dailies, [ran a news story][8], quoting my tweet as the original source. They had a comment from EMT (the local [iPhone-exclusive mobile operator][9]), who apologized that they still haven&#8217;t heard about it from Apple and don&#8217;t know what to say.

From one side I even feel a bit sorry for my friends at EMT for stealing the thunder from their official press if and when they were planning to run it. On the other hand &#8211; it is a great example of casual, yet targeted real-time content bending the borders between &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and social media.
