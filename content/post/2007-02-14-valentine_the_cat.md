Cat of Hearts aka the Valentine&#8217;s Day dinner table decorations reshuffled in the [Three Sisters][2] restaurant. As a sidenote, the 3S hotel which hosts the restaurant would definitely be my #1 choice for a place to stay at if I didn&#8217;t live in Tallinn but just travelled here occasionally.
  
The whole evening was just perfect. The oysters very fresh (as the should be on a Wednesday, as most places up north here fly their batches in every Thursday). Our friend Jenny the Sommelier did a fabulous job with matching wine: a proper Beaujolais (not one of those bubblegummy grape juice drinks of Noveau) to accompany deer carpaccio and a strong South African Zinfandel with the white and oily cod, as a bit more unorthodox combination. Mmm.
