This Monday will be different.

Instead of waking up to the pile of Slack messages and emails from the weekend, and calendar full of late night US calls ahead, I plan to hang out with baby Stig and the rest of my family.

I am taking a paternity leave and stepping away from my CPO role at [Topia](https://topia.com) until the end of the year. I will stop the day job, but will keep the minimal load of [my board seats](https://tamkivi.com/tag/board/).

For the rest of the summer I hope this looks like a nice family vacation together.

And from September, when the older kids head back to school and Ede takes on some new professional challenges, I expect this to be a new demanding role for me and the then-6-month-old gentleman figuring out life together.

When our first 3 kids arrived, I've taken a few weeks off here and there, but never for such extended periods. Both at [Skype](https://tamkivi.com/project/skype/) and at [Teleport](https://tamkivi.com/project/teleport/), new babies coincided with new roles at new companies... and for many professional fathers the latter tend to dominate. Which put a disproportionate burden on Ede to keep the fort at home, which I am extremely grateful for.

Coming fresh out from a [big Topia One platform launch](https://www.topia.com/blog/the-next-generation-topia-product-suite/), and having a solid team in place to lean on, I have the luxury to finally step aside for the right priorities.

At Topia we have a global policy that any parent can get a month of fully paid parental leave. And in Estonia, [parents can use up to 18 months of government paid (up to a cap) leave](https://www.sm.ee/en/parental-leave). Yet, traditionally and overwhelmingly this time ends up being the "mother's vacation".

First, there is the up to two weeks meant specifically for fresh fathers. When I look at Estonian statistics, [the number of fathers who make use of that](http://andmebaas.stat.ee/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TKS08) has grown to 50% (up 5X from 2007) of men, but on average we do it for 9.5 days per child (up only 3X in the same period).

But if you [look at the equal opportunity 18-month parental leave, the difference is stark](http://andmebaas.stat.ee/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TKS09): out of the 44752 parents on leave in 2018, only 1325 or mere 3% were male. 

Well, in the very beginning of a child's life there are some good biological needs that only moms can cover. But I do believe the role of parenting should be more balanced. There are pay gaps, cultural norms, personal priorities, certain egoism and other aspects to conquer â€” but in no universe should these lead to a 97:03 score between parents.

75% of my offspring are boys. Maybe the example of this year will help to tilt their choices in the future too.

Let's go.
