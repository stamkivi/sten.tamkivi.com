I would like to thank all of you 8332 unique visitors (yes, [you too Teller][1]) coming from 106 countries for finding this blog in 2007 and for reading through those 29372 pages.

The fact that over half of you have come back more than once is great. The 239 of you who have over 200 visits per year under your belt &#8211; really, I wish I managed to post that often&#8230; Make your life easier and [subscribe to the feed][2], like 171 loyal readers have already done.

A year ago there were zero hits and no feeds here. Your time spent means a lot to me. Especially as I know you are not numbers, but real people.

Have a great 2008 and talk to you soon!
