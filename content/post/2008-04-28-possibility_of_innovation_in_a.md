[Thomas L. Friedman wrote in the Herald Tribune a few years ago][1] a column that acknowledged, and probably injected a lot of self confidence to innovators outside of the usual suspect American hightech hubs. Written from an angle of criticism towards the American high school system, I found his text much more useful read upside down &#8211; thinking about how the more remote areas previously known for their cheap labour and mass quantity low tech production are winning share on the global innovation arena. &#8220;In a flat world people can now innovate without having to emigrate,&#8221; as Friedman put it in rhyme.

Now in one of the recent issues of FastCompany, [Richard Florida took a look back and found that the innovation world has not gone flat afterall][2]. Highly recommended read as a whole, but I picked out a few interesting facts for myself:

  * _Of the roughly 170,000 patents granted in 2003 in the United States&#8211;which gets applications for nearly all major inventions worldwide&#8211;nearly 80% went to Americans, Japanese, and Germans. The next 10 most innovative countries&#8211;the usual suspects in Europe, plus Taiwan, South Korea, Israel, and Canada&#8211;produced another 15%. The rest of the world accounted for only 5%, with India and China responsible for just 0.4%._
  * _Indian and Chinese entrepreneurs founded or cofounded roughly 30% of all Silicon Valley startups in the late 1990s, generating $20 billion in annual revenue and about 70,000 jobs._
  * _There are about 150 million (!) people in highly mobile, global creative class who migrate freely among the world&#8217;s leading cities&#8211;places such as London, New York, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco_

What Friedman originally called for as producing a comprehensive U.S. response &#8211; encompassing immigration, intellectual property law and educational policy &#8211; is more valid than ever in this situation&#8230; but maybe even more so for the &#8220;receding valleys between spikes&#8221; as described by Florida. Umm&#8230; like Estonia?
