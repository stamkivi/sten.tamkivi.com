[Skype 3.5 beta update][1] that went out yesterday features a very neat way to share video content. Add videos to your mood message that your contacts see, create multichats with embedded video to discuss it with friends, etc.
  
This is a project that has been cooking in my team&#8217;s kitchen for a while so I&#8217;m personally very interested in your feelings towards the new experience. Do you like it? Is the experience natural? Does your computer behave fine when playing videos? Is there anything we can improve?
  
Please [download Skype 3.5beta for Windows][2] and play around with it. And [ping me][3] with feedback or speak up in [community forums][4] what you think. Thanks!
