[NIN][1]&#8216;s [Downward Spiral][2] was probably the favorite album of mine in 1994.
  
So when [Priidu][3] forwarded me the [Johnny Cash][4]&#8216; version of [Hurt][5] above I had a little emotional shock wave. On one hand I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve missed something this powerful made of a song that left a mark as it was originally. And on the other hand, if you see the video for the first time only today, post the passing of Cash a few years ago, you are entitled to even deeper layers of additional meanings and references from it as an epitaph.
