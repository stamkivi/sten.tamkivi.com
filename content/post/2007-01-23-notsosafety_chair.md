I was quite proud of the job I did fixing [Kusti][2]&#8216;s child safety chair this time. It&#8217;s one of those models which can be used either way, facing the direction of travel or the opposite. In theory, at least, as in the rear-facing mode it usually remains under weird angle and kind of wobbly. Not this time.
  
&#8230; until I looked on the back seat after driving about 10 minutes. There had been a quiet squeak a minute before from the passenger, but one of those happy kinds, so I did not pay attention at once.
  
Kusti actually seemed to be enjoying the new, kicked-back easy rider style but I&#8217;m not sure that is as safe as the chair manufacturer intended.
