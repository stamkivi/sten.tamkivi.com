The below are reading notes of some good old truths, new aha-s and pro tips from a pretty good concise communications guidebook called [As We Speak: How to Make Your Point and Make it Stick][1] by [Peter Meyers][2] and [Shann Nix][3]. Mostly focussed on public speaking, especially to larger audiences &#8211; but touches upon other topics as well, such as small meeting settings, managing crisis communications, using comms & presentation technology and structuring 1:1 tough conversations.

The book was assigned as reading for a brief reflection essay in the [Generative Leadership class at Stanford][4], but I would (and have already) recommended it as a no-brainer purchase for any manager to hand out to people on their team who need a little comms help. They&#8217;ll get through it in a few hours and be grateful for the few very tangible things they can implement the same day.

**Content**

  * Fill the _first 7 seconds _on stage with a meaningful, grabbing message 
      * Tempting to start with greetings, introduction, house rules &#8211; nothing happens if these follow from 8th second, not from the very beginning
  * Never _end_with the conclusion of Q&A (the answer you gave to question randomly asked as last) 
      * prepare a &#8220;dessert&#8221; closure to use after that, to control the message/tone people are left with
  * No prepared outline survives the CEO (oh, hi, Niklas, Michael, Josh & Tony! :)) 
      * design your structure with Q&A-like main content part
  * Stories need coordinates: when, where, who 
      * Start with the platform of Ordinary -> tilt the platform to unnatural state -> regain balance (through struggle)
      * (very similar to what James Buckhouse of Twitter & Dreamworks [was talking to us about][5])
  * Brain processes images 60X faster than words
  * Match the _modality_in dialogue, Q&A 
      * When question contains language for &#8220;_sounds_ like&#8221;, have the answer include &#8220;I _hear _you&#8230;&#8221;, not based other senses such as &#8220;it _feels_ like..&#8221;, &#8220;it _looks_ like…&#8221;

**Delivery**

  * Audience gathers additional messaging from your voice / effects 
      * ex: high pitch: empathy, low: authority
  * No such thing as _too fast _speaking 
      * The issue usually is of _rhythm_ (no change in pace, monotony, no/misplaced pauses)
  * Vary staccato (&#8220;yes we can&#8221;) with legato (&#8220;I have a dream…&#8221;)
  * Enter from stage right… 
      * _in Western cultures!_ (following the reading direction of audience)
      * when you don&#8217;t need to shake any hands (entering from left doesn&#8217;t make you turn your back to audience)
  * Divide the audience to Left/Right/Front/Back quadrants 
      * consciously alternate which quad you are speaking to
      * aids especially to detect if you tend to miss out Back completely
  * Sync physical stage movements with _linking phrases_(&#8220;that leads me to…&#8221;, &#8220;speaking of which…&#8221;) 
      * Stay still on landing phrases
  * The point of the final dress rehearsal is to _not_ stop when (not if!) anything goes wrong &#8211; practice for overcoming hiccups

**State**

  * Pre-performance routines (aka preparation patterns) help to control state 
      * Active ones (jumping, laughing) release serotonin in the brain (for confidence, joy)
  * Distract your brain from negative focus (&#8220;I will forget&#8221;, &#8220;they fill find out I don&#8217;t know enough&#8221;) by _asking yourself positive_ _questions_ 
      * NB! not just abstract &#8220;positive thinking&#8221;, trying to hypnotise or some new age stuff &#8211; just _enforce mental search_ for positive
      * not closed &#8220;will it be interesting?&#8221;, but open ended &#8220;what is the most compelling part?&#8221;
  * Belief = what a _particular person considers always to be true_ 
      * stands on illustrative facts
      * ergo, to change a belief: clearly state a new one and explore facts to support it

**High-Stake Situations**

  * In hostage negotiations: distinction between _liking/respecting_ the taker VS _creating a bond_ 
      * Book recommendation: [Hostage at the Table: How Leaders Can Overcome Conflict, Influence Others, and Raise Performance][6] by [IMD Professor George Kohlrieser][7]
  * In dialogue/argument, never talk more than 3-4 sentences at a time 
      * Whoever asks the questions, drives the outcome
      * Passive responder (stream of arguments) eventually loses
  * Reward small concessions in argument 
      * NB! careful with nodding &#8211; signals agreement, not just thanks
      * verbal is safer (agree, makes sense, thanks for that)
  * Paraphrase, not parrot phrase (word for word) to signal receiving the point
  * Crisis communications: meet needs for security, connection & contribution &#8211; in this order 
      1. Here&#8217;s what we know for sure &#8211; certainty (anything!) calms hysteria
      2. Here&#8217;s what we don&#8217;t know
      3. Here&#8217;s what I think &#8211; personal gut, analysis, beliefs
      4. Here&#8217;s what _you_ can do
      5. Here&#8217;s what you can count on from me &#8211; commitment
      6. Here&#8217;s why it is worthwhile to make the effort &#8211; greater purpose, not false optimism
  * Whichever medium/modality (phone, video call, email, live speech) you have for communication, try to &#8220;warm it up&#8221; 
      * face-to-face conversation still as ultimate benchmark
      * &#8220;I:You ratio&#8221; (mention &#8220;I&#8221; once per every 10 &#8220;you&#8221;-s)
      * In audio conference, pause at least every 7 minutes for interaction 
          * 18 minutes is the sharp attention drop-off with no return
          * &#8220;tag&#8221; questions with <Name> + bridge + <Question> to enable response 
              * <Question>, &#8220;what do you say, &#8221; + <Name> much harder to react to
      * Try to get into &#8220;live audience&#8221; state on the phone
  * When entering a new situation/project/organisation, map your personal communications dashboard 
      * One person per line
      * Fill out for each: Needs, Intended Outcome, Communications Strategy (frequency, mode)
