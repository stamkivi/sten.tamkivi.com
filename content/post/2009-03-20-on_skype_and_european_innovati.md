I had an honor to speak at [Stanford University][1] on March 9th, as part of their European Entrepreneurship & Innovation Thought Leaders seminar series (see [web site][2] and [Facebook group][3]). I truly enjoyed the experience, meeting students, faculty and guests and joining a dinner in a smaller circle later for fascinating follow-up conversations around entrepreneurship.

Here are the slides I used:

<div style="width:425px;text-align:left" id="__ss_1174035">
  <a style="font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;display:block;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/seikatsu/the-story-of-skype-stanford-2009?type=powerpoint" title="The Story of Skype (Stanford 2009)">The Story of Skype (Stanford 2009)</a></p> 
  
  <div style="font-size:11px;font-family:tahoma,arial;height:26px;padding-top:2px;">
    View more <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/">presentations</a> from <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/seikatsu">seikatsu</a>.
  </div>
</div>

As you might notice, my slides were just a light framework this time and most of content was oral and followed by interactive discussion. Unfortunately it is slightly more complicated with video this time. Please [follow the instructions here][6], but beware that you need to create an account with the [Stanford SCPD site][7] (which you will hopefully find useful for accessing any other free seminars content they offer) and the videos are served using Silverlight, which may or may not be compatible with your choice of operating system or browsers, like Chrome.
