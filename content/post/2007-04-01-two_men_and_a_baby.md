If you&#8217;re hanging around [Covent Garden][2] and don&#8217;t quite feel up for shopping it can be amazingly hard to find a place to sit down at that would offer a glass of wine AND be baby friendly (e.g. not loud and smoky).
  
Those witty Eastern Europeans always find a DIY solution if a commercial one is not available. [Kalm][3] serving wine & cheese from Tesco&#8217;s, on a bench behind a nearby church this time.
  
(And no, it was just cookies and juice for [Kusti][4], if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re thinking here.)
