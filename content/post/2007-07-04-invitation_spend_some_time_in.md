[Saul][1] & [the team][2] have [softlaunched][3] [Seedcamp][4] and the applications for the first event in London in September is now open.
  
**Why?**
  
[Europe has so far under-delivered in terms of globally successful technology startups][5]. From securing funding to developing the right network, young entrepreneurs in Europe face challenges in building globally competitive technology businesses. Through the provision of seed capital and a world class network of mentors, we want to provide a catalyst for Europe&#8217;s next generation of entrepreneurs.
  
**What?**
  
Seedcamp is an intensive week long event held in September in London targeted at young entrepreneurs from across EMEA. There will be a diverse mentor network of serial entrepreneurs, corporates, product designers, venture capitalists, recruiters, marketing specialists, lawyers and accountants that will help the teams put together the foundations of a viable business.
  
**Who?**
  
Young, commited, eager, unfunded (yet), creative European startups with 2-5 founders. See the full [application criteria][6].
  
**Bonus**
  
At the end of the week the venture capital houses will make the funding decision to invest â‚¬50K each in 5 teams for a 10% stake.
  
I very much hope to see at least one Estonian group among the 20 there! Don&#8217;t hesitate to ping me if you need a push. Or just [apply here][7].
