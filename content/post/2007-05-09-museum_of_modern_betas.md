In today&#8217;s world of the overcrowded communication and overwhelming hype, the [MoMB blog][1] really stands out.

Get a fulfilling feed of what&#8217;s up and coming (or &#8220;gone into public beta&#8221; in tech speak). From fancy web 2.0 social mashup services dreaming of a quick acquisition to geeky experiments on what AJAX can do for transforming applications online.

Very few words. Black and white. Small is beautiful.
