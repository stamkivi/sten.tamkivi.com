Spent an inspiring day at [The Intersection Event][2] at Googleplex. [Full agenda is here][3] and my notes from the sessions below.

<!--more-->

**Women**

Panel: [Helene Gayle][4] (CARE), [Sheryl WuDunn][5], [Lorraine Twohill][6] (Google), [Jennifer Pahlka][7] (Code for America)

  * A new microlending model which also takes local micro savings in as capital, more effective virtuous cycle. Cases where a $2 loan to a woman triggers notable spillover family & community change.
  * There are 60-100 million women &#8220;missing&#8221; in the world versus the natural demographics (birthgiving related deaths, girls in india get 50% less medical attention and vaccinations, abuse, etc)
  * We wrote a book on these issues &#8211; but who reads a book in the US, so we took the topic to other media. A film with massive twitter follow-up. A mobile game &#8220;9 minutes&#8221; to teach women in india about pregnancy, one minute per month
  * Google gives $100M of cash to charity, but about $1B in technology
  * Models are transferring back to developed world: microloans in Bronx, addressing teenage pregnancies in Western Europe
  * Many social issues are still rooted in isolation of affected individuals, creating group dynamics is where technology can be most effective (mobile, internet cafes in Afghanistan). Also, role models don&#8217;t work if the target group have no way of seeing them.
  * Daughter management: &#8220;I won&#8217;t pay for your wedding, but will pay for your college&#8221;

**Artistic Creation**

[Marla Olmstead][8] &#8211; 12 year old painter

  * Helps to approach something you&#8217;re doing without knowing you are not supposed to be doing it (for age, skills, finances, whatnot)

**Entrepreneurship**

Panel: [Jason Yotopoulos][9] (SAP), [Reid Hoffman][10] (Greylock, LinkedIn), [Tim O&#8217;Reilly][11]

  * In information age you go out and search for people, in network age you inject yourself in a network so that people can find you (from [Reid&#8217;s TED talk][12])
  * You can have two kinds of company cultures: missionary or mercenary. First tends to work better.
  * Networks, marketplaces and platforms as the underlying layers (Reid&#8217;s investment thesis). Many of the startups attacking big issues (like education) don&#8217;t try to position themselves in this layer, which makes them a lousy VC investment despite all the social good.
  * Myth that entrepreneurship is what happens when other people leave us alone. Actually every startup needs a platform to build on, networks around them, government&#8217;s support (even if just moral, but also regulatory, taxes, education for staff etc). Surrounding support should increase network density and reduce friction &#8211; and just maybe provide direct incentives.
  * 6M mom&#8217;n&#8217;pop stores in India, absolutely no transparency in that part of the value chain (SAP attempting to get wireless POSis out)
  * [The Web 2.0 Labs][13]: initiative on community-based educational technology (ed tech) projects.
  * Disruptive startups take $10 of revenue off an incumbent and replace with with $1. Some (guess who) still think this is destructive, but because of the accessibility it enables, this is actually progress.
  * Some phrases that you are soaked in when growing up in US: &#8220;It&#8217;s just business&#8221;, &#8220;The main goal for companies is to make profit for shareholders&#8221;.Early LinkedIn rule: if what we&#8217;re doing shouldn&#8217;t be printed on the front page of NYT or you couldn&#8217;t tell your friends over dinner &#8211; we should not do it.
  * You have to be both contrarian and right. Contrarian doesn&#8217;t always mean &#8220;contrary to common wisdom&#8221;, but just something that is ignored by others. Given that, how do you break out through the noise, stand out of the crowd?
  * Even while being contrarian, you shouldn&#8217;t leave networks and become a single node. Maybe there is a smaller network of complementing contrarians?
  * Tide rises all the boats. Startups have always executional challenges, but there is much more forgiveness if you&#8217;re on the right tide.
  * Code for America, Vittana, etc kind of social startups need a shift in capital structures, including foundations learning how to do tech investments
  * All venture investors look for high growth. How can something be high growth today if it doesn&#8217;t rely on technology is an interesting question. Starbucks?
  * [Coursera][14] changed charging for courses to charging only for the certification in the end. Most disruptive businesses are also business _model_ innovations.

**The Click Moment**

[Frans Johansson][15] &#8211; author of [The Medici Effect][16]

  * The business case for diversity
  * New book: [The Click Moment: Seizing Opportunity in an Unpredictable World][17]
  * {{< youtube nRAkko6WZbs >}}
  * More videos of [Frans talking about his books][18] &#8211; very entertaining speaker
  * Sweden&#8217;s largest agricultural export product: Absolut Vodka
  * Serena Williams&#8217; first memory of anything is playing tennis. Gladwell&#8217;s 10000 hours really works in sports, because the rules of the game are stable. Reed Hastings didn&#8217;t have 10k hours of video rental experience before Netflix. Branson didn&#8217;t have any experience in airlines, etc. It is OK if you are about to change the rules of the game.
  * The issue with trends is that if you know of one with so high certainty you can safely bet on it &#8211; then everybody else knows about them too.
  * Purpose of strategy is to convince yourself to act. Reject the predictable plan, though.
  * [Mirror&#8217;s Edge][19] &#8211; a game that changed team formation dynamics
  * Education is structured around some foundations that don&#8217;t sound right in the real world. Do you worry if a 25-year-old has 26-level math? Why does it matter in 8th grade?

[Evan Williams][20] (Obvious, Twitter, Blogger, etc)

  * The risk with the Lean Startup movement is that if you reduce this to just a sequence of attempts to throw spaghetti at the wall as cheaply as possible, you might take the bold vision out of it completely.
  * Building something _you_ wanted to exist in the world is a hack against that.
  * Faking is a useful skill for a leader, for example projecting confidence to your team about the future when you can only be confident about the uncertainty. I am usually confident about the big things and less confident about the small ones.
  * [Medium][21] is a place to share stories, ideas, knowledge that is longer than 140 characters not just to your friends.
  * Consumer and enterprise are too different DNAs, Blogger was tempted to go to enterprise (even had a pilot at Cisco), but rejected it.
  * I care for the essence of a product. I am not one of those saying that adding more features is bad. I am against feature creep that changes the essence of the product, trying to make it something else. Google search has gazillions of features, but how you use it has never changed: you type in the box.

**Google Car**

{{< youtube cdgQpa1pUUE >}}

**Science**

Panel: [Steve Jurvetson][22] (DFJ), [Nathan Myhrvold][23] (Microsoft), [Greg Brandeau][24] (Pixar, Disney)

  * Biotech is probably most &#8220;scientific&#8221; entrepreneurial scene. Other &#8220;complex&#8221; ones, like space travel, are often better implementations based on known scientific facts, creating less new fundamental knowledge.
  * Pixar software team was fed by New Jersey Tech, which happened to be very strong in computer graphics research. You don&#8217;t need to be the best known university globally.
  * Science is as close to magic as anything we have. When you understand a new aspect about how nature works, you can do something that looks utterly unfair advantage to everyone else.
  * Humanity has never really had a positive arc heading to the future. It was more about ups & downs, bad and good seasons variating on the field. Moore&#8217;s law has been heading up for 110 years now!
  * Innovation is ideas having sex.
  * SpaceX has lowered the cost of space flight by 10X &#8211; only natural if the underlying tech had not been touched for 25 years. It will get another 10X when you make rockets reusable &#8211; imagine throwing away a plane after every flight! It will be cheaper to fly around a world in a rocket on orbit than an _equivalent_ plane. First for one person, then 7, then for 100.
  * Already today there are more electric vehicle drivers in China than cars in the US. 1300 manufacturers, mostly 2-wheelers still. EV is inevitable, US spends $2B/day on car fuel.
  * Drop in cost of reading and _writing_ gene data is making Moore&#8217;s law look flat.
  * Humanoid robots in production are replicating unskilled labor &#8211; learning and optimising what they do by watching the routine hand movements.
  * When the Human Genome Project started, biology was not one of the &#8220;big science&#8221; areas for funding &#8211; natural counter pressure from incumbent areas to its rise.
  * It we don&#8217;t discover anything surprisingly new beyond the Higgs boson from LHC, it will be much harder to raise funds for next $10B+ core science research project
  * New telescopes are costing $B
  * Recurring arguments on the &#8220;end of innovation&#8221; are flawed. Look at single country, single industry numbers. Look at median salaries not raising in US since 1975 &#8211; ignoring averages and growing poor-rich gaps. Ignoring structural changes in parallel (employment in agriculture -> manufacturing -> …)
  * Killing a cow is the least effective way to make a steak.
  * $100M satellites in orbit are less powerful than modern phones.

**Social Innovation**

[Bill Draper][25] (Draper Richards), [Randy Haykin][26] (Outlook Ventures)

  * Started in venture capital in 1959.
  * Returned 16X on LPs money in India in 6 years &#8211; pays to be first.
  * Granddaughter [Jesse Draper][27] started [Valley Girl Show][28]
  * John Wood (Room to Read) &#8211; book: [Leaving Microsoft To Change the World][29]
  * Bill&#8217;s book: [The Startup Game][30]
  * When your learning curve flattens &#8211; either change jobs or write a book
  * People who think immigrants are taking jobs away are crazy. We&#8217;re sitting at Google!
  * Despite his known harshness even Steve Jobs had empathy, to the user.
  * Serial entrepreneurs with a very quick turnover look suspicious &#8211; are they able to really stick through the tough times?
  * Don&#8217;t ever wait for a board meeting to tell your VC the bad news
  * Became the first investor in Skype by accident. Hired [Howard Hartenbaum][31], asked him to go to Europe because it is less crowded there. Tracking the guys behind Kazaa (sued to death by Hollywood by then) found them writing a business plan for the next thing&#8230;
  * Early days the VC deal was: we put up the money, you put up the blood-sweat-tears and we&#8217;ll split it 50-50. If it was a $4M deal, we&#8217;d take $2M, give one to Kleiner and one to Mayfield. Much more competitive now.
  * Carnegie had a philosophy: 1st third of your life you get educated, 2nd &#8211; make a lot of money, 3rd &#8211; try to give it all away intelligently. Making money is OK and keeps your home happy, but giving it away is much more rewarding.
  * The social entrepreneurs we&#8217;ve backed that have done the best have first been successful in a money making organization.

**Gratitude Awards finalists**

  * [Zaya.org][32] &#8211; physical boxes to take educational content to non-connected schools
  * [The IQ Collective][33]
  * [Mytonomy][34]
  * [Beyond 12][35]
  * [Springboard Collaborative][36]
  * [Vittana][37] &#8211; microlending to students in developing world. Has financed 8000 students to date. 2013: $15M, 25000 students, tripling. Ex-Amazon founder, backed by Khosla.
  * [Motion Math][38] &#8211; games that teach kids math. A week of gaming: +10% skills.
  * [The World We Want Foundation][39] &#8211; funding platform for social action projects initiated by young people.
  * [Kytabu][40] &#8211; textbook subscription service launched in Kenya. Use cheap $25 tablets to access pages, paragraphs of textbooks on a time-bound subscription basis, for fractions of cents. Mobile payment penetration in Kenya 78%, $1B+ daily volume.
  * [OneGoal][41] &#8211; college persistence program to reduce the number of drop-outs.
