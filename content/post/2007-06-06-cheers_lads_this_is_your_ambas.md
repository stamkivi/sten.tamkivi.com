Landing in Tallinn late last night our plane from London was greeted literally at the door by [Nigel Haywood][1], Her Majesty&#8217;s Ambassador of the United Kingdom of Great Britain to Estonia himself.

He was personally handing out maps of the city as well as brochures on how to stay safe in the Old Town after 67 pints of beer to the England supporters flying in for the [Euro 2008 qualifying game][2] between the two countries tonight. 

How cool is that?

PS: The Embassy also has some [travel guidance][3] online. Just doesn&#8217;t feel the same, does it?
