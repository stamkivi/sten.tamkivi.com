With Estonian parliamentary elections coming up on March 6th, I agreed to participate in the _&#8220;Minu hääl&#8221;_ (&#8220;My Voice&#8221;) TV ad campaign by the [Electoral Committee][1], featuring a bunch of celebrities (from music, theatre and such) and a few people from the street (like some elderly and your&#8217;s truly).

These are not party ads, e.g not urging you to vote for anyone in specific, but to just remind you to go and vote. Especially as with our [notorious e-voting][2] (with both chip-enabled ID cards, but also mobile ID&#8217;s as a new thing this time!) it is just a 3 minute effort from wherever you happen to be.



I liked the wordplay they built this thing around &#8211; the Estonian word &#8220;hääl&#8221; meaning both &#8220;voice&#8221; and &#8220;vote&#8221;. See [all the ads in the series here.][3]
