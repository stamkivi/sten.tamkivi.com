Read a [great column by Clive Thompson in Wired&#8217;s September issue][1] on how big numbers (and lack of numeracy there) affects people&#8217;s charity decisions.

> He studies a troubling paradox in human empathy: We&#8217;ll usually race to help a single stranger in dire straits, while ignoring huge numbers of people in precisely the same plight. We&#8217;ll donate thousands of dollars to bring a single African war orphan to the US for lifesaving surgery, but we don&#8217;t offer much money or political pressure to stop widespread genocides in Rwanda or Darfur.
  
> The problem isn&#8217;t a moral failing: It&#8217;s a cognitive one.

Most of us can count to about 7 in an instant. Throw 6 matches on the table and everyone can say instantly that there are 6. Throw 8, and most people will already have to calculate (even if it is a quick 4+4 operation in the back of the head). Throw 83 matches and the answer is &#8220;many&#8221;.

As a sidenote: if you can&#8217;t relate to this, there is a good chance you&#8217;re an [autist][2]. (Remember [Rain Man][3]?)

For some reason, the point Thompson raises about maintaining a grasp of proportion when it comes to large numbers suffering has become more and more visible around us in the recent years:

  * 2,974 people died in the infamous terrorist attacks on 9/11. The retaliation in Iraq has now cost [600,000 lives and counting][4].
  * People have donated over a million pounds to support [finding Madeleine][5], despite of the controversy surrounding the poor kid&#8217;s dissapearal. Wonder how many million-pound funds are there to support the 2.8 million children under 15 with AIDS?
  * As a friend of mine noted, the media coverage as well as his personal feelings were much stronger around [Colin McRae&#8217;s helicopter crash][6] if compared to the news of [88 people dead in Thai plane crash][7] the same day.

Somehow I think that you don&#8217;t really need to be a Bill Gates to optimize your charitable giving to a place where it can fix the most of pain.
