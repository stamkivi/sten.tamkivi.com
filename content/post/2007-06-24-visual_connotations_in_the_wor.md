Boy, this designer has had fun with the wine label. I can just imagine him sitting in front of a fancy Mac and starting with a blank InDesign worksheet. To point out some of the obvious examples of what was twirling in his head around the French Rabbit brand:
  
* the letters &#8220;bb&#8221; in brand typography
  
* still motion hopping on top (powered by methane exhumes from the rabbits, as noted by someone)
  
* oh, do carrots hop now as well, with enough inertia to bounce off the &#8220;o&#8221; in chardonnay?
  
* &#8220;bitemarks&#8221; into the green area of the package
  
* the overall choice of [TetraPak][2] instead of a glass bottle so that your mom would accidentally buy it for carrot juice
  
PS: Didn&#8217;t try it, but was told it was quite drinkable&#8230; in the 4-euros-for-a-litre category.
