Congrats, [Dick & Christoph][1] at [PamConsult][2] on [winning the Skype Mashup Competition 2007][3]! Even though I have not sent a [fax][4] in like 10 (ok, maybe it is just 5) years I am sure that [PamFax][5] has conservative old school business users flocking as we speak.

There was a whole bunch of [good entries][6], really happy as it was the first competion we held. I&#8217;ve actually used a few of them before, like [Twitter4Skype][7] and [Anothr][8]. However, [my humble request][9] did not show up yet &#8211; so there is still a chance for you to develop it for the next round. Or before.
