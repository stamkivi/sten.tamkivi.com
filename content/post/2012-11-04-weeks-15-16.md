### Stanford GSB Sloan Study Notes, Week 5-6 (15-16), Autumn quarter

This post consolidates my notes from two weeks instead of a normal one, yet will be a bit more concise than usual too, for a few reasons: I was down with flu for several days and had to miss a few classes and then the midterm exams in Financial Accounting and Organizational Behaviour changed the normal scheduling.

Also, the first session of the latest addition in our core timetable, [STRAMGT 259: Generative Leadership][1] by Dan Klein yesterday was too&#8230; experiential to take any notes, really. Basically, we did three hours of improv theatre. It was a lot of fun, but instead of getting into the theory here &#8211; get the book: <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400081882/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400081882&linkCode=as2&tag=seikatsu-20" target="_blank">Improv Wisdom: Don&#8217;t Prepare, Just Show Up</a> by Patricia Madson. And say &#8220;yes&#8221; more to whatever life throws at you, go with the flow and see what happens.

For additional entertainment, here is an experiment shared by my classmate [Marc][2] who is lucky to take a [Behavioral & Experimental Economics][3] class by [freshly Nobel-prized][4] [Al Roth][5]: primatologist [Frans de Waal][6] showing how even monkeys reject unequal pay (see especially from 2nd minute).

{{< youtube g8mynrRd7Ak >}}

And now on to the regular programming. Covered in this issue:

  * Why people suck at predicting when they finish a task
  * How overdiversification, and especially uncontrolled aquisitions lead to dysfunctional conglomerates
  * Lemmings following lemmings, but not sheep
  * Predicting future divorces
  * Research from surveying 10,000 founders that quantifies the impact of common &#8220;gut decisions&#8221; like picking investors or sharing stock between co-founders
  * Guest speakers explaining how they&#8217;ve used creative incentive schemes to get more out of porn site classification crowdsourcing and VAT payments in China
  * The impact of investment lags on IP value creation in startups and established companies

**GSBGEN378 &#8211; Decisions About the Future (Hardisty)**

  * [Planning fallacy][7] &#8211; tendency for people to underestimate how long it will take for them to complete a task 
      * Article: [Exploring the “Planning Fallacy”: Why People Underestimate Their Task Completion Times][8]
      * Actor-observer differences: more realistic when predicting how _others_ perform, rather than you
      * Even if there is strong optimistic bias between bestguess/optimistic/pessimistic predictions, even the worst-off optimistic guesses are not devoid of information (highly correlated with actual results still)
      * Likewise, subjects who self-rate higher confidence, will actually perform better
      * When pondering out loud, most of focus on future planning (71%) or future problems (3%) in building prediction. Only 7% references to past problems/successes. 
          * Yet, more realistic estimates when a) recalling past experiences and b) relating those to task at hand.
  * [Save More Tomorrow][9] &#8211; using behavioural economics to increase employee saving 
      * Convince people to commit ahead to increasing their saving rate _with every next salary increase_
      * Null hypothesis difference: 
          * Standard economic model: workers have no interest in joining, because they have already chosen their optimal savings rate.
          * Behavioral economic model: workers will find this attractive and will join.
      * Prescriptions often have a _second-best quality &#8211;_ e.g, simplest advice might not be the best (too short therm, &#8220;quick-hack&#8221;)
      * Hyperbolic agents procrastinate because they (wrongly) assume whatever they will do later is less important than first step. And procrastination produces inertia. 
          * An investment study showing median number of changes in pension plan asset allocation over lifetime was zero. (More than half participants retire with same asset allocation they started saving with!)
          * In a mixed stock/bond portfolio, stocks appreciate much more over lifetime which throws allocation out of balance.
  * [Libertarian paternalism][10]: philosophy advocating design of institutions that help people make better decisions, but do not impinge on their freedom to choose (ex: opt out)
  * [Tobias Preis][11]: GDP vs future orientation correlation shown based on Google searches for past and future year numbers from different countries 
      * Future Orientation Index: [raw data PDF][12]
  * For top athletes, first few years of training focuses on identifying appropriate arousal (stress) levels 
      * then next years on timing peak performance using the right levels
      * Ex: 10 days/year max, 2-3 months/year @ top 2% performance
  * [Halo effect][13] 
      * Same teacher ranked more handsome based on communication style
      * can reduce framing/bias with explicit callouts (&#8220;I bet eating made you sleepy&#8221; in the beginning of afternoon meeting -> the other party doesn&#8217;t think they are sleepy because you are boring)
  * Visualization proven to increase people&#8217;s support to causes, ex: climate change 
      * Pictures higher impact than graphed data
      * some causes are &#8220;lucky&#8221; to have powerful visuals more naturally available
      * compare to Singularity Institute & AI research, NASA pitching for funding of a never-before mission

**STRAMGT279 &#8211; Global Strategic Management (Roberts)**

  * &#8220;Judo economics&#8221;  &#8211; use the size of an incumbent as a weapon 
      * costly for a giant to swat a fly, so it lets the fly live (until not too bothersome)
  * Vertical integration to get returns from operational improvements 
      * Presumes long-term
      * Hard to replicate contractually between independent parties (ex: consulting contract to share benefits of improvements)
  * Conglomerates are more alive in emerging markets because&#8230; 
      * capital markets less effective to diversity otherwise
      * management skills in undersupply
      * family ownership -> personal wealth diversification through M&A
  * Japanese [keiretsu][14] provided conglomerate-like coordination without ownership 
      * common bank, trading companies, regular cadence of meetings between chairmans&#8230;
  * Debt is hard and unforgiving, equity is soft. 
      * not enough cash for dividends? tough luck…
      * not enough cash to repay your debt? default…
  * M&A is often motivated by CEO / executive interests, rather than shareholders&#8217; 
      * prestige, equity plans, total pay correlated strongly to company size
      * integration success or failure harder to measure, longer term
  * Most M&A positive return for sellers, lawyers, bankers and negative for buyers. 
      * Winner&#8217;s curse: bidder who is most off when estimating value is most likely to win.
  * M&A spillovers test: _which specific underused assets_will the synergies come from post merger? 
      * management? knowledge? technology? sales force?
  * Diversification discount on conglomerate valuation 
      * tend to keep financing weak and underinvest in progressing BU-s
      * due to management complexity, corporate politics, innovators dilemma…
  * Illinois had quite recently a law that only allowed banks with maximum of one branch!
  * Xerox 
      * using executive assistant roles as mentorships 
          * &#8220;talent development on steroids. 1-2 year assignments to go deep and broad learning how the org operates through the lens of a senior executive&#8221;
      * family metaphore for culture (Burns): &#8220;When you&#8217;re inside the family, you don&#8217;t have to be as nice as outside. Let&#8217;s stay civil and kind, but we have to be frank. And the reason why we can be frank is that we&#8217;re in the same family.&#8221;

**OB278 &#8211; Organizational Behaviour (Flynn)**

  * Psychology of blame 
      * Situational change from A (all was good) to B (now bad)
      * Blame subconsciously assigned to _what has changed_ &#8211; despite the change being relevant or now
      * E.g. if there is a new person in the project, easily assumed to be to blame
  * Conflict resolution splits into 
      * Task goals &#8211; short term, fix the problem
      * Relationship goals &#8211; long term, maintain the relationships in the process
      * 2 often in conflict & one shall dominate 
          * The more interactive/intimate the communication, the more likely relationship goals prevail (face-to-face chat VS email)
  * Agreeing to a protocol increases trust _to the contract_, not the other party 
      * Why legal and ethical/moral solves are often so different?
  * Reacting to problems interpreted as &#8220;has to&#8221;, while anticipating (being proactive) as &#8220;wants to&#8221; (by clients, team, bosses) 
      * drop present-focus (from task -> relationship goal)
      * find out _who_the other party is ASAP 
          * needs (to be liked, have status, achieve X…)
          * priors (CV, jobs, but more specifically _successes_…)
          * views (of self, you, world)
      * Identity markers around people&#8217;s physical location (clothing, workspace design & decorative items, …)
  * Book: [Divorce in Psychosocial Perspective: Theory and Research][15] by Joseph Guttman 
      * Experimental research into what causes long-term relationship breakdowns and how to predict
      * Spoiler: highest correlating predictors are asynchronous signals during conflicts between parties (eye rolls, smirking)
  * Height <-> authority link proven both ways 
      * experiment: guess the height of a speaker introduced with different titles to different audiences
      * &#8220;grad student&#8221; perceived to be 2&#8243; shorter than the same person as &#8220;tenured professor&#8221;
      * talk show hosts seated 6-8&#8243; higher than guests (and thus the hiding behind a desk)
  * Canned laughter in TV sitcoms 
      * less about prompting the &#8220;right time to laugh&#8221;
      * more to compensate for increasing trend to watch TV alone (and thus not laugh)
      * TV ratings proven to increase in the singles segment, not across the board
  * &#8220;Salting&#8221; the tip jar 
      * defines the norm, not just &#8220;tips or not&#8221;, but also &#8220;how much others consider appropriate&#8221;
  * Milgram&#8217;s sidewalk experiment: 
      * a single person staring in the sky in NYC makes people flee (madman?), 5 people doing that simultaneously draws a large crowd who also start staring up
  * Lemmings effect is amplified by narrowing the category of reference 
      * relevance doesn&#8217;t matter (again!) &#8211; &#8220;people with the same birthday as you&#8221;
      * &#8220;people staying in this room&#8221; more effective than &#8220;… in this hotel&#8221;
  * &#8220;Sheep follow sheep, not lemmings&#8221;
  * Same data can be framed based on which subset of the group you need the lemming to join, e.g for stealing: 
      * deviant framing: &#8220;less than 2% of our visitors steal&#8221; -> eliminated stealing
      * normative frame: &#8220;more than 1000 visitors steal&#8221; -> 3X more stealing
  * Both _popularity_ and _momentum_matter to create following 
      * manufactured social proof: author buying their own book to hit the charts (after which natural sales follow)
      * Yahoo! experiments showing download counts to free MP3-s had strong cascading influence after some song got just slightly ahead
  * [George Lakoff][16] &#8211; UC Berkeley research on language use in persuasion
  * Diffusion of responsibility in groups 
      * in emergency shouting &#8220;HELP!!!&#8221; is less effective than &#8220;YOU, with the glasses, call 911!&#8221;
      * a group reminder is less effective than personal (&#8220;is it just me?&#8221;)

**MS&E 472 &#8211; **[Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders][17]

Guest: [Noam Wasserman][18], The Founder&#8217;s Dilemmas

  * Book: [The Founder&#8217;s Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the Pitfalls That Can Sink a Startup (Kauffman Foundation Series on Innovation and Entrepreneurship)][19] 
      * _&#8220;Drawing on a decade of research, Noam Wasserman reveals the common pitfalls founders face and how to avoid them. He looks at whether it is a good idea to cofound with friends or relatives, how and when to split the equity within the founding team, and how to recognize when a successful founder-CEO should exit or be fired. Wasserman explains how to anticipate, avoid, or recover from disastrous mistakes that can splinter a founding team, strip founders of control, and leave founders without a financial payoff for their hard work and innovative ideas. He highlights the need at each step to strike a careful balance between controlling the startup and attracting the best resources to grow it, and demonstrates why the easy short-term choice is often the most perilous in the long term._
      * _The Founder&#8217;s Dilemmas draws on the inside stories of founders like Evan Williams of Twitter and Tim Westergren of Pandora, while mining quantitative data on almost ten thousand founders.&#8221;_
  * Startup failure reasons: 
      * 35% related to product-market-fit (product mgmt, functional mgmt, market problems)
      * 65% people problems (interpersonal tensions, between founders and/or with hired employees)
  * Data on 10,000 founders
  * Core founder dilemmas 
      * When to found? &#8211; core founder 
          * [Kaufmann Foundation&#8217;s sketchbook][20] for pre-founding decisions
          * Only 16% of start-ups are solo-founded
      * Building the team (co-founders) 
          * More than 50% of startups have co-founders who know socially (friends & family), but not professionally 
              * Paradoxically, data shows despite of these social ties, these founder teams are more likely to break down
          * Founder teams that start with seeking decision making consensus, co-CEO setups, one-founder-one-vote struggle with adjusting to needed role divisions later
          * Relationships-roles-rewards tension: co-founding with your best friend on consensus model -> can&#8217;t go and say you want 60% of stock
          * 73% of startups split equity between founders in the first month on a static agreement 
              * 33% equal split
              * 12% near-equal (1-10% diff)
              * 15% moderate gap (11-20%)
              * 19% large gap (21-40%)
              * 21% huge gap (>40%)
          * Can you really do a static contract? Is the strategy stabilised, business model set? Roles & skill requirements known? 
              * Founder time commitment, personal uncertainties?
              * &#8220;just because you&#8217;re founding, doesn&#8217;t mean life events will stop happening to you&#8221;
          * Conditional contracts listing commitment (full- or part-time?), milestones as if-then decision trees, with buyout terms as the worst case scenario
      * New-Venture hiring
      * Beyond the team (investors, partners) 
          * Board control as investment consideration
          * 50 months from founding less than 50% of founders are still in the business, in 100 months: 25% left 
              * 73% of that are firings
          * Control vs financial tradeoff: 52% more value retained by founders who give up both CEO and board control 
              * Do you want to be the King or Rich?
      * Exit dilemmas

Guest speaker: [Panos Ipeirotis][22] (NYU Stern School of Business), Crowdsourcing: Achieving Data Quality With Imperfect Humans &#8211; [@ipeirotis][23]

  * Blog: [Behind Enemy Lines -> Computer Scientist in Business School][24]
  * Problem: building complex targeting models \_fast\_  &#8211; plain linguistic analysis not enough 
      * Ex: plane ads next to articles near crast inappropriate; FDA banning drug ad placement next to swine flu coverage
      * AdSafe &#8220;adult web site classifier&#8221;: asking people to categorise sites in four buckets (general audience .. porn) 
          * Undergrad: 200 siters / hr, cost $15/h
          * Amazon Mechanical Turk: 2500 sites/hr, cost $12
          * BUT: quality dropping enormously and checking/fixing very expensive, manual
  * Expectation Maximization Estimation: establish &#8220;correct&#8221; labels by majority vote, estimate error rates for workers & weigh worker rates by quality 
      * Weigh down the answers of those who more often diverge from group
      * Algorithm not novel, invented in 1979 with doctors & interns
      * Challenge 1: spammers figure it out (0% \* 85% + 100% \* 15% = 15% spammer error rate is lower than good user: 85% * 20% + 85% + 20% = 20%)
      * Challenge 2: human biases &#8211; what is offensive and what is not depends on role, culture, etc
  * Establish a quality score, a scalar measure that distinguishes spammers with unpredictable (random, constant) answers to any question from humans whose biases a predictable on data (e.g when answering A, spammer can mean anything, but a biased human means consistently B compared to peers)
  * Quality-sensitive payment 
      * Set goal: $1 for 90%
      * For workers above: full pay
      * For others: payment divided with redundancy needed to reach goal (3 workers for 90% => $0.33 pay)
  * Fair to reimburse for difference in past work quality as the understanding of quality improves 
      * Reduces churn!
  * &#8220;Google bias&#8221; &#8211; people submit URLs that you already know about being bad 
      * Beat the Machine: incentive to find URLs classifiers fail on &#8211; $1 if you beat the machine, $0.001 if you don&#8217;t
  * Difference between &#8220;unknown unknowns&#8221; & &#8220;known unknowns&#8221; 
      * e.g multilingual porn &#8211; once a new domain is submitted, it could be expected that derivatives in different languages also exist / are offensive
      * Reduce rewards based on classifier confidence
  * Crowdsourcing workers behave like mice &#8211; cognitive reward system similar to food pellets: 
      * Bad answers introduce probabilistic nuisances: delays between tasks, timeouts
      * Good answers introduce variety, change, visible improvements
      * See: [Misery module for Drupal][25]
      * Spammers witnessed to drop extra quickly and move on… and 15-20% spammers start submitting good work!
  * Book: Kahneman&#8217;s [Thinking, Fast and Slow][26] (again!)
  * Modern-day slot machine: email. People check it constantly because sometimes it pays out… and most of the time it does not.

Guest speaker: [Balaji Prabhakar][27] (EE/CS department, Stanford): [Societal Networks][28]

  * Societal networks 
      * meeting point of tech, policy & economics
      * vital for society, ex: transportation, healthcare, energy, recycling, …
  * Less than 2% of US passenger miles in public transportation 
      * 48% SG, 94% HK
  * Turning small awards for good behaviour into a lottery 
      * $0.05 per each empty can returned to recycling VS 1/2000 chance of getting $100?
  * An experiment in some provinces of China (and Taiwan?), every VAT receipt is a lottery ticket 
      * 30M Yuan in rewards paid on 900M Yuan of tax collection! (98-02)
      * [Lottery Receipt Experiment in China][29] (Junmin Wan, Fukuoka University)
  * Stanford Congestion and Parking Relief Incentives: <https://stanfordcapri.org/> 
      * Commute at off-peak hours, earn credits, redeem for rewards

**CS207 &#8211; [Software Economics][30] (Wiederhold)**

  * For Pareto optimal operations consider the _investment lags_ 
      * Inhouse hiring vs contractors/outsourcing
      * Private hosting vs cloud services
      * Organic growth vs acquisitions
      * New technology development vs more marketing for existing products
      * The surrogate of value of speeding IP generation up is income, not cost
  * Counterintuitively: startups have a longer lag than established companies 
      * Latter can ramp up their resource spending faster
      * NB! Presumes similar product complexity, start-ups looking faster is a function of scaled-down scope of MVP + later iteration?
