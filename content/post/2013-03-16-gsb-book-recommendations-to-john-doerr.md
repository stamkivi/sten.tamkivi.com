Last week, [John Doerr][1] of [Kleiner Perkins][2] was speaking in the [View From The Top][3] speaker series at Stanford GSB. (Video is yet to come online, but I [shared some notes here][4].) As part of his speech, John gave his book recommendation to the audience and in return asked the audience to email him 3 book suggestions back.

I got curious and, as I sent in mine, also asked if he would share back what the rest of the school thought. Angela Valles from KPCB was kind enough to do just that (thank you!) and for sake of easier sharing, I dropped the entire thing as it was now to a Goodreads list &#8211; open for voting, sharing, reading and other good social things.

It is quite an eclectic selection of things we read and recommend our guests here at the GSB (between MBAs, Sloans, PhD students, faculty and guests of the day), I have to say. Just a few titles were mentioned more than once in first ~200 emails. There is a lot of to-be-expected business bestsellers, but also quite a few fiction titles. And what I like is the balance of seemingly extreme ends: physic lectures meet religious texts, Ayn Rand meets Karl Marx, US history matched with stories from Asia and Europe.
