This is an actual screenshot of an attempt to get a weather report for [Tartu][2], Estonia on my iPhone, using the standard Weather app, powered by Yahoo data.
  
What&#8217;s the joke?
  
Yes, the city of Tartu used to be called Yuryev at some point. Namely [between 1030 and 1061][3] when Prince of Kiev, Yaroslav I the Wise burnt down the wooden fortification dating back to 7th century and built his own.
  
Just checked, [Yahoo! Weather on the web][4] has the up-to-date name. So apparently it takes a tunnel through Apple to get medieval.
