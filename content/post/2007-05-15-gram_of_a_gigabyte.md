One of those moments when you feel really old and feel the [Moore&#8217;s law][2] kicking in with a full blow. It reminded me the file server at my first job at Primex Data (nowhere to link to, as the company went down too early in the internet days) in 1993 which had a massive and expensive (a thousand dollars?) 300MB harddrive to host a few dozen users and still have plenty of room for the file archives of the BBS I used to run there.
  
Pictured above is the new 1 gigabyte memory card I got for [my phone][3]. Weighs one gram and cost about 30 Euros. Is that a grey hair I see in the mirror?
