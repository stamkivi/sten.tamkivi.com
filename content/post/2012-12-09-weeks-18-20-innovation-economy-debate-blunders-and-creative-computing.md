### Stanford GSB Sloan Study Notes, Week 8-10 (18-20), Autumn quarter

Not to worry, despite of the three week scope in title this is not a monster-length post. Between a lovely wedding, an unexpected funeral and Thanksgiving break in between my focus has temporarily shifted a bit away from school as this quarter concludes. Do enjoy the little there is to share below &#8211; and as special gift to reader A.M., yes there are more videos.

[<img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8350/8248046509_0f05c10e1a_n.jpg" alt="Marc & Bill" width="320" height="240" />][1]

A notable off campus educational highlight  last week ago was an event at [A16Z][2] where  [William Janeway][3] (being interviewed by [Marc Andreessen][4] on the photo above) discussed his book <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1107031257/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1107031257&linkCode=as2&tag=seikatsu-20" target="_blank">Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy: Markets, Speculation and the State</a>. Combining his 40 years in venture capital with a PhD in Economics, Bill has great insights into when, how and where governments should play any role financing tech innovation and where progress should be left for markets. And as a curious subtopic &#8211; the need for an occasional bubbles in the latter case.

Covered further in this issue:

  * How to avoid small groups polarizing towards extremes in debate 
      * _Kõrvalmärkusena Eesti lugejaile: jah, teadus teemal Reformierakond VS Väike Grupp!_
  * Centralization VS distribution of control in global organizations
  * More history of Presidential candidates screwing up in public
  * Financial ratios and common size reports in accounting
  * Effective networking tips&#8217;n&#8217;tricks exchange with Sloan classmates
  * How computing changes human bodies and the definitions of creativity
  * How big internet players have changed hardware IP value chain

<!--more-->

**GSBGEN378 &#8211; Decisions About the Future (Hardisty)**

  * [What would Jesus drive?][5] &#8211; a campaign angle to get the Bible Belt folks thinking about perceptionally leftist climate issues 
      * Attribute scaling issue in US: 12->14MPG saves more gas than improvement from 28->40MPG!
      * &#8220;Sales comparison oriented&#8221; MPG is not intuitive measure for consumers to understand actual gas spend (vs European l/100km)
  * Integrative approach to decision making research 
      * Mix of economic, psychological, anthropological methods
      * &#8220;Objective, subjective, collective&#8221;
      * Disciplines feeding into each-other iteratively
  * Contingent valuation (Schkade) 
      * &#8220;existence value&#8221; &#8211; assigned to items without immediate personal utility, for ex polar bears 
          1. how much would you give to keep polar bears from going extinct?
          2. would you prefer getting $1M or polar bears not going extinct?
      * interestingly, common answer zero can either mean worthless or priceless
  * Participatory process 
      * Involving stakeholders in decision making can improve information gathering (Fraser)
      * Also serves extra-decision goals (Peterson 2010)
  * [What&#8217;s up with that][6] &#8211; climate change sceptic blog
  * Group polarisation 
      * [The Law of Group Polarization][7] (Sunstein)
      * The org structure needs to be well tuned &#8211; just diversifying enclaves might actually kill the voice of the weaker subgroups
      * Solution: encourage enclaves BUT create a regular feedback/checkin loop with the larger, more diverse group (society)
      * (Yet unpublished) research by Hardisty shows the polarisation that happens over face to face happens over video calls, but does NOT happen over group IM chat
  * Normative Theory of Sequential Decision Making 
      * Solution: 
          1. Estimate the number of candidates you can interview
          2. Reject the first 37%
          3. Accept the next candidate that is better than all previous candidates
      * People tend to stop their search too early (Seale & Rapoport 1997; Rapoport & Tversky 1970) 
          1. Potentially because they are working on pre-established baseline (don&#8217;t need to look at the first 37% options to create one)
  * Choice bracketing 
      * Broad bracketing: assessing the consequences of all of them taken together 
          1. The more yogurt consumers buy at once, the more rare flavours they buy (Simonson & Winer, 1992)
          2. Assigning value to optionality? Purchasing a hypothetical &#8220;future self&#8221; who could have changing tastes?
      * Narrow bracketing: making each choice in isolation
      * Buy 1 Snickers a week or a 12-pack for 3 months? 
          1. Choosing 3 snacks (1 per week) in advance, 64% chose a different snack for each week
          2. Choosing 1 snack each week, 9% chose different ones each week (Simonson 1990)
      * Low income people buy more lottery tickets one at a time than when deciding once how many to purchase (Haisley 2008)

**STRAMGT279 &#8211; Global Strategic Management (Roberts)**

  * Listing abroad (London, NYC) helps peripheral companies _look _more global, helping hiring and sales backdrop 
      * Ex: an Argentinian / Italian steel pipe producer who has trouble attacking international talent
  * Traditional org models 
      * Centralization for max quality/control
      * Multi-local federation of decoupled national companies 
          * Pre-Union Europe: plant in every country to avoid trade barrier hassles
          * Philips didn&#8217;t enter the VHS/Beta fight with their own standard because their own US unit went with Matsushita
  * Since 90s: loosely coupled, &#8220;disaggregated&#8221; models 
      * Non-incremental innovation has become more important than static position (efficiency & responsiveness) of the past
      * Empowering units + mandating commonalities / incentivising sharing
      * Loose or variegated coupling instead of tight/decoupled extremes
      * Learning through linkages
      * Expensive: 
          * communication & management overhead
          * ambiguitiy & conflict

**GSBGEN565 &#8211; Political Communications (**[David Demarest][8]**)**

  * State of the Union speech 
      * Law actually requires it _to be delivered_ to Congress
      * Used to be in writing, oral presentation quite recent idea in 20th century
      * Safe and self-congratulatory: but when you take risk & danger out, gets boring
      * Often just skimming the surface of a long laundry list of topics (submitted by every agency and lobby group imaginable)
  * Massive speech needs to be a pyramid 
      * every argument builds to a larger one, ultimately consolidating into the Big Idea
      * &#8220;when you wander too far from the core message, the speech loses momentum&#8221;
  * Consider jokes standing outside of your speech context 
      * … because that&#8217;s how they&#8217;ll be spread on Youtube
  * [Dan Quayle][9] Bloopers
  
    {{< youtube aYJVfd5WRhE >}}
  * Debates (beyond Lincoln in 1860) were considered inappropriate in US tradition, squaring candidates directly against each-other &#8211; returned with the raise of new media (radio, TV)
  * Most watched: 
      * Reagan vs Carter 80M
      * Palin vs Biden 69M
  * Ford in 1976 debate: &#8220;Soviets are not dominating Eastern Europe&#8221;
  
    {{< youtube w8rg9c4pUrg >}}
  * Carter announced a [Vietnam draft dodgers amnesty][10] in front of a military conference 
      * obviously got boo-ed, many questioned why he chose not to use a supportive hippie gathering
      * the coverage later showed him as _decisive_, making an unpopular decision &#8211; a narrative he was lacking
  * Dukakis answer on the question suggesting his wife&#8217;s rape (in debate)
  
    {{< youtube DF9gSyku-fc >}}</p> 
      * react emotionally to a question if needed, but answer it then
      * suppressing emotion looks inhuman, not professional
  * How to be gracious in victory in a way it doesn&#8217;t compromise your principles? 
      * Ex: Bush refused to dance on the Berlin wall for the problems it would create for Gorbatchov for next needed steps
  * Building towards consensus between opponents AND with audience 
      * &#8220;can we agree on the principle that…&#8221;
      * often no-one gives up on their edge with agreeing (early)
      * insting to hold on to your bargaining chips, even if fundamentally you don&#8217;t care that much
  * People care about issues, not process 
      * if media talks about how well your campaign is run: you&#8217;re not talking about issues enough!
      * rare exception: Obama 2008
  * Close needs to be powerful, impactful, uplifting and dramatic: &#8220;the listener has to be able to relate their future to the one you&#8217;re painting&#8221;

**ACCT219 &#8211; Financial Accounting (Guttman)**

  * Business analysis & valuation 
      1. Understanding the Past 
          * info collection, understanding the business and accounts, financial ratios, cash flow analysis
      2. Forecasting the Future 
          * income statement, balance sheet & cash flows
      3. Valuation 
          * cost of capital, valuation models (residual income, cash flow-based), valuation ratios, complications
  * Always mind the _sensitivity_ 
      * How sensitive is #3 to assumptions made in #2?
      * Will something like 10% change in real net income blow the model up?
  * [Financial ratios][11] 
      1. Profitability (ROA, ROE, ROFL)
      2. Asset turnover (TA, AR, Inventory turnover)
      3. Risk, Capital Structure and Liquidity (short term: current ratio, A/P turnover; long term: debt to assets)
  * Possible eliminations needed to achieve comparability of ratios 
      * non-operating & non-recurring items?
      * after-tax interest expenses (to avoid financial structure distortions)?
      * accounting quality distortions (ex: renting VS capital leasing of facilities)?
  * [Earnings Management to Avoid Earnings Decreases and Losses][12], Burgstahler & Dichev (1997) 
      * showed there is a visible dent in earnings distribution
      * [<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-712" title="Earnings management - dent near zero" src="http://sten.tamkivi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/earnings.jpg" alt="Earnings management - distribution dent near zero!" width="388" height="266" srcset="http://sten.tamkivi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/earnings.jpg 388w, http://sten.tamkivi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/earnings-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" />][13]
      * no companies want to show &#8220;just below zero&#8221; profits
      * matching effect in more than normal distribution showing &#8220;small profits&#8221; at least
  * Earnings management can be &#8220;real&#8221; (actual decisions on changing spending, incentivising sales in period) or purely &#8220;accounting&#8221; 
      * Latter is often still GAAP-compatible, not just fraud: deciding time to recognise something, usage of reserves
  * Agency problem: you rarely get sued for &#8220;real decisions&#8221; to return to profitability &#8211; even if they actually are not in shareholder&#8217;s interest
  * You can make educated guesses of a firm&#8217;s industry by just looking at its common size reports (on percentage bases, not absolutes), ex: 
      * service business: low inventory, turnover not meaningful
      * banks: deposits & loans render many other ratios/proportions minuscule (share volume of cash)
      * retail: high inventory, high turnover (and way higher for wholesale)
      * utility: low inventory, high dividends (= low retained earnings)
      * presence/high proportion of goodwill in M&A intense industries / fast growth

**STRAMGT259 &#8211; Generative Leadership (Klein)**

  * See [the separate post for reading notes of As We Speak book][14]

**Networking Essentials**

A class-designed co-curricular session to exchange tips&#8217;n&#8217;tricks for building and maintaining useful networks.

  * Too much focus on the most connected nodes in networks 
      * Bandwidth issues
      * Often seemingly less-connected _edges_ of a network are more interesting, because they could bridge entire very different / less connected networks
  * TIARA (from [The 2-hour Job Search book][15] (Google preview)) &#8211; a replicable routine to extract professional insights from someone in limited time, asking about: 
      * Trends
      * Insights
      * Advice
      * Resources
      * Assignments
  * Disagreement/differing views in first meeting is a great hook for follow-up 
      * Ex: e-mail a link to research a week later
      * Confirms you were listening
      * Builds further conversation
      * You can contribute facts (or at least other experts opinion) rather than emotion/getting personal

**CS547: Human-Computer Interaction Seminar**

Note: full archive of [videos for this course available here][16].

Guest speaker: [Jofish Kaye][17], Yahoo! (ex-Nokia): Comfortable, Communal and Creative Computing

  * MIT Media Lab&#8217;s future kitchen research project: [Counter Intelligence][18]
  * In 1988 [Mark Weiser][19] of Xerox PARC [proposed ubiquitous computing][20] at three scales: inch, foot & yard 
      * Wait… phone, tablet, TV!
  * Learnings from studying tablet users 
      * People often buy them &#8220;for the heck of it&#8221; &#8211; e.g there is no particular application in sight, more exploratory
      * Single-user centric security/privacy/personalization models can drive increasingly attached/personal use 
          * Ex: won&#8217;t lend your tablet to a friend to check e-mail quickly
  * Book: Lucy Suchman, [Human-Machine Reconfigurations: Plans and Situated Actions (Learning in Doing: Social, Cognitive and Computational Perspectives)][21] 
      * How interaction with computing _reconfigures_ the human body & physical space. From tablets to Wii to interacting with smart furniture to…
  * &#8220;Kitchens have been historically very good at organising families&#8221; 
      * Paper: [Notes on Fridge Surfaces][22] (PDF), Swan & Taylor, Microsoft Research
  * The perception of tablets as devices for content _consumption_, rather than creation 
      * Yes, BUT don&#8217;t miss the changing notion of creation here
      * People might type long texts less, but curate/mix/collage more &#8211; notion of creation is changing
      * Critics say this is inherently more shallow
      * Conservatively one could argue that rap is not music, because they scratch vinyl discs & don&#8217;t play guitars &#8211; but these definitions are purely cultural and change
      * Why to even have this conversation: worrying perspective of a device you can buy and only consume with &#8211; and need to spend more money to create anything
  * Call for experiment: have a small group commit to communicate to each-other only non-textually for a week (audio, video, calls & -mail)
  * Authenticating into tablet/tv screen with your phone?

**CS207 &#8211; Software Economics (Wiederhold)**

Guests: [Ron Burback][23] and [Vishal Sikka][24] (CTO of SAP).

  * On shifting the IP creation & supplier power around: 
      * Google buys 400k, FB 200-250k servers/year…
      * &#8230;but from Intel, Foxconn, etc guys in the stack, not from Dell, HP or IBM
