Just a note that led by recent examples of [Jaanus][1] and [Skype blogs][2], this blog is now also [trackback][3]-free. The precious time I put aside to maintain this site will go into semi-manually sorting through trackback spam no more.

I&#8217;ve used the [FeedBurner][4] [FeedFlares][5] since the beginning and they do add a [Technorati][6] referrals count, among other widgets such as the [del.icio.us][7] bookmarkings, to entry footers both here as well as the RSS versions delivered to your feed reader. If I didn&#8217;t, I&#8217;d get the [counter provided by Technorati][8].

Why? I just like to know (and share) if and who builds on what I&#8217;ve said.
