Had the pleasure to chat with [Cyrus Farivar][1] yesterday, a man whose work you might have read in The Economis, NYT, Wired, PC Mag and Engadget among other places. Most recently he [has covered the Estonian cyberattacks][2], a topic I believe is very important for the world to learn about and from.

Hope I could help him a bit with his [upcoming book on the Liberating Effects of a Wired World][3]. I&#8217;m quite in the loop what has happened in Estonia and have some (second hand) understanding about South Korea & Iran. Comparing the story of Senegal into this picture is something to look forward to. ðŸ™‚
