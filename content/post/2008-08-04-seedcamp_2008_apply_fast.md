Just a quick reminder that this year&#8217;s [Seedcamp][1] is getting close and the application deadline is already this Sunday, August the 10th. 

As a reminder:

> _Seedcamp is where Europe&#8217;s top young founders can come together in one place._
> 
> _From securing funding to developing the right network, young entrepreneurs in Europe face challenges in building globally competitive technology businesses. Through the provision of seed capital and a world class network of mentors, we want to provide a catalyst for Europe&#8217;s next generation of entrepreneurs._

(See also my [invitation post from last year][2] for some background and the great [Seedcamp 2007 recap video][3])

There was [just one Estonian entry &#8211; RealEyes][4] &#8211; last year and unfortunately they did not make the shortlist. So if you&#8217;ve been playing with an idea to start your own company, get your act together and [apply now][5] to get a proper kickstart.

This year, there is also a potential shortcut to the shortlist. Just go and win the [Video Pitch contest][6].

It looks like I can make it there this year again as one of the [mentors][7]. Last year was fun, hope to see you there.
