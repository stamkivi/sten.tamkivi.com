[Shel Israel][1] has written a quite [extensive entry on recent cyber attacks][2] on Estonia, following the riots 2 weeks ago, and their potential impact.
  
He also asked me to chip in and [I did][3].
  
I still think that no matter how tense and grim it looks today, smart people regardless of their nationality can get in sync on the history, display enough empathy and respect to each-others&#8217; past tragedies to peacefully cohabit this small country going forward.
  
Despite how some leaders of an aggressive neighbor envision it should go.
