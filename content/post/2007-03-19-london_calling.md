From today to April 13th (that would be 4 weeks) I am working from our London office. Partly it has to do with [my new team][1] which is dominantly based in London. But no less important reason has been the strain my weekly back-and-fourth bouncing has put on my family. So they&#8217;ve come along.

The only thing to suffer from my extended stay here is the rapid growth of frequent flier miles, really.

Looking forward to the long-postponed catchups with [Kalm][2], Kristi, Catherine, [Saul][3], Eileen and others. I hopefully make one of the [OpenCoffe Clubs][4], likely the one next Thursday. You never get time for these things when coming over for 1.5 days a week.
