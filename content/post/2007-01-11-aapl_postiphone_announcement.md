So, the [Apple iPhone][1] is out. There are [enough blogs][2] covering every single aspect of that little piece of history made, so I will not dwell on the product features much. I want one very badly. You want one. And if you don&#8217;t, you likely will at some point quite soon.

Instead, let me share some initial thoughts I had from the amateur investor angle. No buy/sell/hold verdicts, just aspects to consider.

<!--more-->

  * [AAPL][3] is on fire here. They did not come out with a cool phone, I believe they created a new segment for themselves. When buying the iPhone you do not comparision shop based on detailed feature list, but buy yourself a ticket into a harmonious bundle of great functionality, form and usabilty of a specific device plus another puzzle piece in the evergrowing very integrated ecosystem (iPod, iTunes, iLife, [Apple TV][4], MacOSX, .Mac, &#8230;) that has made Apple now to drop the obsolete &#8220;Computer&#8221; part of it&#8217;s name. Forget the hours spent at [GSMArena][5], just get your communication and portable media stuff solved and move on.
  * The known history with iPod is a good comparision point. There were a number of great portable MP3 players already out there in 2001 when Apple launched, however they [have now sold close to 70 million pieces][6] and [had a quarter of market share globally in 2005][7]. In comparision the global [smartphone sales in 2006H1 boosted to 41 million units][8], growing 57% on the path to increase their share in the 1 billion overall mobile handset units in the world. Play with the figures however you want, if Apple gets a double-digit share of the 2012 smartphone pie, absolutes are huge.
  * The relationship between Apple and mobile operators are yet to be seen. It is weird to see iPhone, with all its multimedia-intensity to lack 3G, which probably saddens charge-by-mobile-data-transfer-volume incumbents and might build hesistance in more advanced markets (Japan?) where operators and consumers even don&#8217;t rememeber what GPRS and EDGE were. If they ever knew in their 4G-bandwidth networks. I don&#8217;t know enough about US mobile market to understand what does [Cingular][9] give to Apple, but they certainly benefit from being the sole operator for initial iPhone hype. I&#8217;m more interested to see how Apple will handle Europe. Hopefully without country-by-country exclusivity deals.
  * Some market fun from yesterday&#8217;s announcement time:
  * AAPL actually _dipped_ for a moment when Jobs started his keynote with a line like &#8220;Today I&#8217;m going to talk only about Mac&#8230;&#8221;. Shows how much emotion was and is out there around this topic.
  * Jobs currently holds [5,426,451 of AAPL shares][10]. Which means that he made around US$40 million for the 1h47m he spent on MacWorld stage, rockstar as he is. Which is a much better billing rate per hour than [George Michael&#8217;s previous &#8220;world record&#8221;][11] was. ðŸ™‚

  * **ANOTHER TIDBIT:** it has been brought up before as a legal risk and potential settlement liability for Apple that the [iPhone brand is actually owned by CSCO][12]. CSCO even has a [line of Skype phones called Linksys iPhone on the market][13], so the brand has been used in a similar segment. The fact that iPhone was announced as iPhone and not something else (as opposed to Apple TV, formerly known in pre-launch rumors as iTV) indicates that likely AAPL and CSCO already have an agreement on the usage terms? **UPDATE:** Nope, still [a quick lawsuit coming up.][14]
